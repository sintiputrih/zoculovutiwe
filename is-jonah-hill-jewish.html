He talked a bit about his spirituality during the press cycle for The Wolf of Wall Street as his character, Donnia Azoff, was partly inspired by a Jewish man. The semi-biographical film adaptation of the memoir by stockbroker Jordan Belfort (played by Leonardo DiCaprio) described a character who seeks to be seen as white, anglo saxon protestant to fit in among the debauched wealth around him.</p><p data-characters=179 data-current-count=179 data-injectable=false>In a 2014 interview with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Jewish Journal</a>, Hill discussed his complicated feelings “being someone who’s Jewish and playing someone who’s Jewish in such an unflattering way.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/You-People-Netflix-Jonah-Hill-Eddie-Murphy.jpg><p data-characters=255 data-current-count=255 data-injectable=false>Hill described himself as “not super religious in a 2014 <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Guardian</a> interview. “I like the parts of Judaism that are about being with your family and being a good person more than the specific rules,” he said. “And lox.

Hill has not publicly commented on his reasoning.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=265 data-current-count=265 data-injectable=false>He inherited the surname from his father, Richard Feldstein, who worked in the music industry in Hollywood.
