That was lit,” Nicole told an appreciative Candelabra.</p><p>An additional clue arrived after her performance from the One Hit Wonder jukebox, as the men in black played the Spin Doctors song Two Princes.</p><p>“Who needs two princes when you have one fire princess?” Candelabra asked.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-who-is-candelabra-on-the-masked-singer>Who is Candelabra on The Masked Singer?</h2><p>The panelists had their guesses ready, with Ken Jeong joking that he believed it could be host Nick Cannon’s baby mama in the costume, Mariah Carey.</p><p>When Nick told Ken he thought he’d know if that was his baby mama in the costume, Ken told him, “Be more specific.”</p><p>While Ken mentioned Mariah had that album Butterfly, he said he was changing his guess to Regina Hall due to her association with Kevin Hart. She appeared in Think Like a Man and About Last Night. He brought up that Regina co-hosted the Oscars in California, too.</p><p>Nicole speculated that it might be singer Brandy since she was a princess in Cinderella. It’s worth noting that the celeb also said “sitting up in my room” as part of her clue package story. Sittin’ Up In My Room was one of Brandy’s early hit songs.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>Robin Thicke said the voice was so “powerful” that Candelabra had to be a professional recording artist. He guessed it might be Anika Noni Rose, who starred in 2009’s The Princess and the Frog.</p><p>Popular guesses circulating online included Keyshia Cole, Tiffany Haddish, and Tamar Braxton.</p><p>With that in mind, viewers might see several big R&B stars unmasked in the coming weeks, as there is speculation Ginuwine or Ne-Yo could also be among Season 10’s costumed celebs.</p><p>The Masked Singer airs Wednesdays at 8/7c on FOX.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rrvNrKueqqOWu6Wv0aKropujY7CwuY6trWiqlZa5qsDYZquvZ6edvG610maamqaUmrmirtGaZKimXam1pnnMmqqknZRiwKq6xp6pZquVlsCwuoxqZ2abnKqytHnAp5tmn6WawLSx0madqKpdmLKtscGsZKKclaPBqsDYaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./the-be-quiet-dark-rock-elite-cpu-cooler-review-where-quiet-meets-quality.html><span>←</span><span>The Be Quiet!
