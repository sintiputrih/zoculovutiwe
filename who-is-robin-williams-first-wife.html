(CNN) — Alzheimer’s disease and dementia are two diseases that many Americans are all too familiar with, but there is another dementia that plagued the late comedian Robin Williams.</p><p>Also What happens in the final stages of Lewy body dementia?</p><p>In advanced LBD, communication often becomes quite difficult. <b>Voice changes, poor attention, confusion, and word-finding problems are common</b>; impaired communication can also lead to anxiety or agitation.</p><p>How long does the last stage of Lewy body dementia last?</p><p>Despite this, little is known regarding end-of-life (EOL) experiences of individuals with DLB and their families. Individuals with DLB survive <b>a median of 3–4 years after presentation</b> [3–5] reflecting shorter survival than those with Alzheimer disease (AD) dementia [4, 6] and Parkinson’s disease (PD) [7, 8].</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=23_Related_Question_Answers_Found></span>23 Related Question Answers Found<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=What_is_Louie%E2%80%99s_syndrome></span><strong>What is Louie’s syndrome?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Lewy body dementia (LBD) is <b>a type of progressive dementia</b> that leads to a decline in thinking, reasoning and independent function because of abnormal microscopic deposits that damage brain cells over time.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=Is_Lewy_body_dementia_the_same_as_Parkinson%E2%80%99s></span><strong>Is Lewy body dementia the same as Parkinson’s?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Lewy body dementia (LBD) refers to either of two related diagnoses—dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) and <b>Parkinson’s disease dementia</b>. Both diagnoses have the same underlying changes in the brain and, over time, people with either diagnosis develop similar symptoms.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=What_causes_death_in_Lewy_body_dementia></span><strong>What causes death in Lewy body dementia?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>In general, the lifespan of patients diagnosed with LBD varies from about 5 to 8 years. Patients <b>die from multiple complications</b> (immobility, falls, poor nutrition, swallowing difficulties, or pneumonia).

It does have characteristics that often can be categorized as likely to occur in the earlier stages and other symptoms that are likely to develop as it progresses.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=How_quickly_does_Lewy_body_progress></span><strong>How quickly does Lewy body progress?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Lewy body dementia is a progressive disease, meaning symptoms start slowly and worsen over time. The disease lasts an average of 5 to 8 years from the time of diagnosis to death, but the time span can range <b>from 2 to 20 years</b>.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=What%E2%80%99s_the_worst_type_of_dementia></span><strong>What’s the worst type of dementia?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p><b>Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease</b> causes a type of dementia that gets worse unusually fast. More common causes of dementia, such as Alzheimer’s, Lewy body dementia and frontotemporal dementia, typically progress more slowly. Through a process scientists don’t yet understand, misfolded prion protein destroys brain cells.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=What_is_the_most_common_cause_of_death_in_dementia_patients></span><strong>What is the most common cause of death in dementia patients?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>According to a 2007 study published in The International Journal of Geriatric Psychiatry, <b>dehydration and general deterioration</b> is the most common cause of death for dementia patients who live to the final stage.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=Is_Alzheimer%E2%80%99s_worse_than_Lewy_body_dementia></span><strong>Is Alzheimer’s worse than Lewy body dementia?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>NEW ORLEANS—Two years after disease onset, patients with dementia with <b>Lewy bodies</b> (DLB) have a significantly worse quality of life than do patients with Alzheimer’s disease or Huntington’s disease, reported researchers at the 64th Annual Meeting of the American Academy of Neurology.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=What_are_the_first_signs_of_Lewy_body_dementia></span><strong>What are the first signs of Lewy body dementia?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p><b>Early Symptoms of Lewy Body Dementia</b></p><ul><li>Decreased or lost sense of smell.</li><li>Interruption in the rapid eye movement (REM) stage of sleep or acting out while dreaming.</li><li>Visual hallucinations.</li><li>Misidentifying objects in low-light environments.</li><li>Confusion.</li><li>Difficulty maintaining attention.</li><li>Memory loss.</li><li>Changes in handwriting.</li></ul><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=What_is_the_life_expectancy_of_someone_with_Lewy_body_dementia></span><strong>What is the life expectancy of someone with Lewy body dementia?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>The average life expectancy for people with LBD after the onset of symptoms is 5 to 8 years. However, individuals with Lewy Body Dementia have lived anywhere <b>between 2 and 20 years</b> depending on their age, the severity of their symptoms, and their other medical conditions.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=Is_Alzheimer%E2%80%99s_worse_than_Parkinson%E2%80%99s></span><strong>Is Alzheimer’s worse than Parkinson’s?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>An Alzheimer’s patient loses both their cognitive function and ability to do anything for their own. When you look at it from this perspective, then Alzheimer’s is usually considered <b>worse off than Parkinson’s</b>.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=What_are_the_signs_of_end_stage_Lewy_body_dementia></span><strong>What are the signs of end stage Lewy body dementia?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Individuals with DLB have a unique symptom profile which may affect EOL experiences, including <b>hallucinations, paranoia, cognitive fluctuations, parkinsonism, and antipsychotic hypersensitivity</b> [9].</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=Does_Lewy_body_dementia_run_in_families></span><strong>Does Lewy body dementia run in families?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Family History</p><p>About 10% of Lewy body dementia cases appear to be tied to heredity, where the person inherits the disease from a parent. When someone has had Lewy body dementia or Parkinson’s disease, his or her family members <b>have a higher risk of developing</b> Lewy body dementia.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=Does_exercise_help_Lewy_body_dementia></span><strong>Does exercise help Lewy body dementia?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>As the disease progresses and the dementia increases, exercise can be hard to do. Therefore, it is important to incorporate exercise in the early and middle stages of Lewy Body Disease. A study suggests that a <b>high-intensity functional exercise program has positive outcomes on balance</b> in these patients.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=At_what_point_do_dementia_patients_need_24_hour_care></span><strong>At what point do dementia patients need 24 hour care?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>If your loved one is unable to live independently and cannot <b>care</b> for themselves anymore, moving into a residential setting <b>will</b> give them the benefit of <b>24</b>–<b>hour care</b> and support.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=What_are_the_end_stages_of_vascular_dementia></span><strong>What are the end stages of vascular dementia?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>As the condition progresses, it damages all brain functions, so the effects can be similar to those of Alzheimer’s disease in the later stages. The later stages include <b>greater levels of confusion, mood changes, and memory problems</b>.
