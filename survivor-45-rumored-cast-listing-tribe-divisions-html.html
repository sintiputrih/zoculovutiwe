And several fans on Reddit think the Blue Tribe seems the strongest from the start.</p><p id=par-21_85>“The frontrunner of the three tribes, in my opinion,” a fan on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Reddit</a> wrote. The fan agreed with other fans who believe that Brando Meyer, the 22-year-old software engineer, likely doesn’t stand a chance. “I do agree, Brando is definitely the first of this tribe to go,” they continued. “However, that could be well into the pre-merge, as this tribe appears to be clearly physically dominant. I’m not sure where the other five will end up, but I’m sure they’ll all make it quite far.”</p><p id=par-22_74>The same user doesn’t have high hopes for the Yellow Tribe. “I honestly don’t see much in this tribe,” they wrote. “It’s between the two other tribes. Sabiyah is clearly not going to mesh with the rest of the tribe, and I predict she’ll be the first out. I could maybe see Emily, Sean, and Hannah forming an alliance, with Emily eventually flipping on them to be on the side of Kaleb and Brandon.”</p><p id=par-23_64>The Blue Tribe welcomes back Bruce Perreault. <a href=#>Bruce was medically evacuated</a> from Survivor 44 after hitting his head during a challenge. While he didn’t play the game long, he has some idea of what’s to come, as he’s hit the beaches of Fiji in the recent past. And he’ll undoubtedly play more carefully moving forward given his unfortunate end in season 44.</p><p id=par-24_8>This story was originally reported by <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Inside Survivor</a>.</p><p id=par-25_12>Survivor 45&nbsp;premieres Wednesday, Sept. 27, 2023, at 8 p.m. ET on CBS.</p><p id=par-26_15>For more on the entertainment world and exclusive interviews, subscribe to&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Showbiz Cheat Sheet’s YouTube channel</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGTAtr7Voq2oql1pgm6%2B1Kamq52UYrCiv9Nmo6KrpJ67qHnTq6CbnV2Ztre10qKmp6tencGuuI4%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./who-is-megan-finney-meet-james-finney-birdman-daughter-on-instagram.html><span>←</span><span>Who Is Megan Finney?
