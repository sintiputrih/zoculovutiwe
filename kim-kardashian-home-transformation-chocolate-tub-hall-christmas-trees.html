According to the mom of four, the elves had left a note in the kitchen saying, "They couldn’t find the mugs, so the hot chocolate’s in the bathtub".</p><p id=e7tb5_tYwgE data-wc=23>By the morning, the chocolate appeared to have solidified in the tub, with elves and marshmallows on top of the chocolatey ice rink.</p><p id=eeFHA71v1fD data-wc=48>As if this wasn't an extreme enough display of Kim's love of Christmas, 'The Kardashians' star filmed herself walking down the hallway which resembled Narnia, with approximately 14 gorgeous snowy fir trees lining the corridor, as she turned into the living room to see someone playing the piano.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/a603f0ef0bdd-412626737185917044010606593027782324836683448n.jpg><p id=eh60jI8w_s data-wc=19>As five white stockings hung along the fireplace, there was a huge brightly lit Christmas tree in the corner.</p><p id=erWrDpQaIPj data-wc=38>The&nbsp;entrepreneur went on to show fans how she was wrapping her presents this year, taking a rather unusual approach to wrapping paper as she put the mountain of boxes in front of a bright white Christmas tree.</p><p id=eUFwdlzW3rn data-wc=63>"I used SKIMS cotton fabric for my wrapping this year", she explained in the video. "I'm going to reuse it and when everyone opens it I'm going to take the fabric and reuse it on stuff that I make for my family, so I thought it was a really fun, cool way to just have something you can use over and over again."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/1f831b3974d9-051a05c97fd1fde9c2f1ccabfda116a1.jpg><p id=e2JIffaWevC data-wc=39>"I just love how it looks, and the technique we used to wrap it", she added.

That’s why I’m introducing a brand-new bra with a built-in nipple. So no matter how hot it is, you’ll always look cold.”</p><h4 class="relatedContentTitleClass_r14hzpr7 hm-heading">You may also like</h4><p id=e63A9tvMS1c data-wc=29>The sales proceeds of the bra reportedly went to nonprofit charity 1% for the Planet.
