Rose competed on Tough Enough in 2015 and subsequently signed with WWE. After a brief run on NXT, she moved to the main roster as a member of Absolution alongside Paige (now known as Saraya) and Sonya Deville. Rose and Deville later broke off on their own and eventually split up, leading to a heated feud that culminated at SummerSlam 2020. After an inconsistent run over the next several months, Rose moved to NXT in 2021 and formed Toxic Attraction with Gigi Dolin and Jacy Jayne."><meta name=author content="Martina Birk"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

After a brief run on NXT, she moved to the main roster as a member of Absolution alongside Paige (now known as Saraya) and Sonya Deville. Rose and Deville later broke off on their own and eventually split up, leading to a heated feud that culminated at SummerSlam 2020. After an inconsistent run over the next several months, Rose moved to NXT in 2021 and formed Toxic Attraction with Gigi Dolin and Jacy Jayne.</p><p>During her time in NXT, Rose reinvented herself, and she won the NXT Women’s Championship. She held the title for over 400 days before she lost the gold in December 2022. Rose was released on December 14, the day after she lost the title, due to risqué content that she was posting on her FanTime page.</p><p>On <a href=#>The Sessions With Renee Paquette</a>, Rose was asked about potentially returning to wrestling. She made it clear that she hasn’t ruled it out for the future, though she’s focused on other projects at the moment.</p><p>“I haven’t ruled it out for sure,” Rose said. “It’s not like the boots are hung up and stuff. It’s not like that. But just right now, it’s not my main focus, but definitely for the future, maybe. We’ll see.”</p><p>Paquette noted that Rose could potentially reunite with her former Absolution stablemate Saraya in AEW, or even her Mixed Match Challenge Partner Dustin Rhodes.</p><p>“Oh, that would be nice,” Rose said. “… I have a few little old schools that we could reunite.”</p><p>When asked to describe what she wants to do moving forward, Rose expressed her interest in competing on Dancing with the Stars.</p><p>“I have a few things I want to do. I want to be on ‘Dancing with the Stars’. I[used to dance]. Way back in the day. I’m no great, great dancer, I have to say, I did more like hip hop, ballet, modern. I feel like that would be really cool. I always wanted to do that. That was just a little bucket list thing and I’m so open to so many different things.”</p><p>Paquette wondered whether Rose would be interested in doing reality television, as she noted that the former NXT star seemed like a natural fit for it.</p><p>“I would love to do that,” Rose said. “Definitely. I would love that.”</p><p>In the same interview, Rose noted that she never got a warning ahead of her release.
