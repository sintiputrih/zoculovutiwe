He continues to star in stellar films and the occasional television program, but more recently has a tendency to veer toward the stage. He’s starred in several high-profile theater releases over the last decade, adding credence to his bona fides as a first-class actor and beefing up his audience base.</p><p data-characters=147 data-current-count=538 data-injectable=true>He’s a wonderful actor and, based on reports, an equally delightful human. Here’s everything you need to know and more about Matthew Broderick.</p><h3 data-injectable=false><strong>Matthew Broderick’s age, family, and place of birth</strong></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/downloadfile-10.jpg><p data-characters=318 data-current-count=618 data-injectable=true>Broderick still looks fantastic at 60 years old, after more than three decades in the world of film, television, and stage performances. He’s been acting since he was a youth in Manhattan, where he lived with his similarly talented parents. His father, James Broderick, was also an actor, as was his mother Patricia.</p><h3 data-injectable=false><strong>Career highlights</strong></h3><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=408 data-current-count=708 data-injectable=true>It’s hard to pick just one or two highlights from Broderick’s lengthy and illustrious career. He’s starred in a few dramas — from Glory to Manchester by the Sea — but Broderick has always shone the brightest in comedy. His comedic offerings, from the aforementioned Ferris Bueller’s Day Off to The Freshman several years later, are remembered to this day as some of comedy’s greatest offerings.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/ferris-bueller-2.jpg><h3 data-injectable=false>Matthew Broderick’s romantic life</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/downloadfile-14.jpg><p data-characters=444 data-current-count=744 data-injectable=true>Broderick found love more quickly than many of his Hollywood counterparts, the majority of whom tend to experience years of relationship woes before finally settling down. In a shift from the norm, Broderick has been married to his wife, Sarah Jessica Parker, for more than 20 years. He tied the knot with the Sex and the City actress in 1997, and the two have been happily married ever since. They share three children: one boy and twin girls.</p><h3 data-injectable=false>Matthew Broderick’s net worth</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/sarah-jessica-parker-clanokW.jpg><p data-characters=289 data-current-count=589 data-injectable=true>Across several decades and dozens of appearances in television, film, and on stage, Broderick has collected a huge amount of money. His current net worth sits around $200 million, according to <a href=#>Celebrity Net Worth</a>, collected from years of hard work across Hollywood productions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=449 data-current-count=449 data-injectable=false>Broderick’s impressive net worth is boosted by contributions from his wife, Sarah Jessica Parker. Parker has enjoyed a career equally — if not more — successful as her husband’s, and has raked in plenty of high paychecks herself. Their family owns a number of properties in New York, several of which sold in recent years for millions. They also own a property in Ireland, in the same area Broderick spent many of his youthful summers.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJon56qlah6psLEq7CtoJmjtG7Fzq5kp52VmXq1u4ykpaivXZavsMHTZqSarKSdsrh5waumnZ2inrCsew%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./685370-drake-sampha-collab-confirmed-instagram-story.html><span>←</span><span>Drake Teases &amp;quot;Something Crazy&amp;quot; Coming With Sampha</span></a>
