The sports drama follows Spencer James (Daniel Ezra), the star player on a high school football team who is recruited to play for the exclusive Beverly Hills High, and details how he straddles the line between his new world of wealth and his much more working class home life.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=603 data-current-count=603 data-injectable=true>The show began its life on The CW, but is now one of Netflix’s most loved offerings, which has only helped to boost its viewing numbers in what’s been a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">tricky year for its original network</a>. The show was renewed for its sixth season quite a while ago and it was set to be released in 2023, yet we are still waiting for a lot of official information, including an air date and confirmation of the cast. The WGA and SAG-AFTRA strikes haven’t helped matters, either, certainly contributing to this lateness as the writers downed tools when scripts were likely to have been in development.</p><p data-characters=253 data-current-count=253 data-injectable=false>Aside from being late, this also means that instead of the usual 20-episode arc, there may be as few as 12 for viewers to dive into. Although nothing has been confirmed, it seems that January 2024 is the earliest we’ll see season 6 on our screens.</p><p data-characters=151 data-current-count=404 data-injectable=true>If you want more information on when All American season 6 might air, which characters are returning, and what plotlines we might see, then read ahead!</p><h2 id=h-when-will-season-6-of-all-american-be-released data-injectable=false>When will season 6 of All American be released?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Taye-Diggs-All-American.png><p data-characters=517 data-current-count=817 data-injectable=true>As mentioned above, there is no official release date for season 6 of All American yet. With that said, history gives us some clues. The CW has a pretty regular schedule for debuts, and as every other season of All American debuted in October (except for the third season, when filming was interrupted by COVID), it’s safe to assume the release was originally planned for then. As a result of the strikes, January now seems like a more likely release month, as the CW does also debut new shows and seasons then.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>What are some potential storylines in season 6 of All American?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Bre-Z-All-American.png><p data-characters=276 data-current-count=576 data-injectable=true>Season 5 left the All American showrunners and writers plenty to work with in terms of character and relationship development, and there’s no doubt that plenty of long-running plotlines will begin to bear fruit in the upcoming episodes (when they finally are released).</p><p data-characters=304 data-current-count=304 data-injectable=false>The shadow of Billy’s death will definitely still be looming over the characters who he knew, and although he is technically gone we may once again see him in flashbacks, as we did throughout the second half of season 5. This means we might even continue to see his backstory and character develop.</p><p data-characters=628 data-current-count=932 data-injectable=true>What will happen to Patience after Miko stabbed her in the final episode of the previous season is also a big question among the fandom. While she is likely to pull through, an act so violent is sure to leave her feeling all sorts of horrible ways, and will certainly make a dent in her fledgling relationship with Skye. On the other end of the spectrum, Specer and Olivia are going to explore a long-distance relationship after a classic airport declaration of feelings. While Olivia is still going to London to pursue her own dreams, the commitment she and Spencer have made will surely be an integral plotline in this season.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Who are the cast of season 6 of All American?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Daniel-Ezra-All-American.png><p data-characters=440 data-current-count=740 data-injectable=true>Apart from Billy, who still might return in a flashback capacity, the cast of All American season 6 looks set to be very similar to the previous seasons. The <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">highly talented Daniel Ezra</a> will be reprising his role as Spencer, and Samantha Logan will continue as Olivia, albeit with less screentime thanks to her new London location. Bre-Z will also return as <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">fan favorite Coop</a>.
