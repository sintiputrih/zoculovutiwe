According to <a href=#>"Dancing With the Stars" judge Carrie Ann Inaba</a>, she once was part of the "Like A Virgin" singer's tour back in the day and was given a hard order. "She gave us this one rule, which I'm so grateful she did. It was, for every minute you're late, you have to pay her $100 out of your paycheck," she shared on "<a href=#>The Jennifer Hudson Show</a>."&nbsp;Despite the tough rule, Inaba admitted that it helped her learn to be on time and stated, "I'm never late. I'm always early."</p><p dir=ltr>As reported by <a href=#>Yahoo! Sports</a>, Madonna worked her backup dancers so hard during her Rebel Heart tour in 2015, that one quitted to her face, a source told Radar. "On another occasion, one of her dancers broke her arm during rehearsals and instead of showing concern, Madonna had a nuclear meltdown," the insider revealed. The unnamed source also claimed that the "Ray of Light" singer made everyone wear black and thinks it's an honor for anyone to work for her, calling her ego "over-inflated." Madonna has a history of hiring young, gay dancers and while she gave them a leg-up in the industry, one claimed that she discards them when she's done with them.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmamxjbIZ3g46mmJ2nnqOubr%2FTnqmnZaKavbbAwK2gqKZdrLa1tIybmJyjpaV6pa3NnJyrq18%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./katie-poulter.html><span>←</span><span>Ian Poulter &amp;amp; Katie Poulter Married, Children, Joint Family Tree &amp;amp; History</span></a>
