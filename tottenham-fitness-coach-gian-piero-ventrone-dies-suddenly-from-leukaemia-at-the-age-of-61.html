His funeral is scheduled for Sunday at 3pm.</p><p>The club issued a statement on Thursday, expressing their devastation: “We are devastated to announce that fitness coach Gian Piero Ventrone has passed away. The 61-year-old joined the Club in November 2021, as part of Antonio Conte’s backroom staff, having previously held roles at Juventus, Catania, JS Suning, GZ Evergrande and AC Ajaccio.”</p><p>“As lovable off the pitch as he was demanding on it, Gian Piero quickly became a hugely popular figure with players and staff. He will be greatly missed by everyone at the Club and our thoughts are with his family and friends at this impossibly sad time.”</p><p>Juventus, where Ventrone spent a decade from 1994 to 2004, also mourned the loss of their former coach, stating: “One of the historic names at Juventus at the turn of the century, Gian Piero Ventrone, has left us at the age of 62.”</p><p>“Gian Piero worked as a Juventus athletic trainer, from 1994 to 1999, helping Marcello Lippi build and look after a Juve side that won everything in Italy and Europe. He returned to Turin from 2001 to 2004, enriching his, and our, trophy collection with other victories. He employed innovative methods in physical conditioning inspired by modern criteria, which led the way in Italy and abroad.”</p><p>“A member of Lippi’s staff when Italy won the World Cup in 2006, he continued to enrich his career, in France, China and England, where he was working before his passing. We will always remember his attention to detail, his work philosophy, and perhaps his greatest talent, the understanding that football – and especially the fundamental components of conditioning and athleticism – was gradually entering a new era. A new era that, in part, he helped write. Ciao, Gian Piero.”</p><br><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlazAr7vWp6CgnaKerm%2B6xmirqKykmruprcxmnaKsnprAtHnCqJicoF2ctqK6jKmgnqqfYsOmutOrpqedXZm2pr%2BMrKydnJWjubp5xaumpmWcmsKsrcSmoJplkal6tbTEZpignV2ks26CkGg%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./tony-carbajal.html><span>←</span><span>Tony Carbajal</span></a>
