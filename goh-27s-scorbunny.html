It teamed up with them to steal food for a living. To blend in with them better, it covered itself in dirt. Scorbunny debuted in <i><a href=# title=JN004>Settling the Scorbunny!</a></i>, where it and its Nickit friends stole <a href=# title="Ash Ketchum">Ash</a>'s <a href=# title=Bag>Bag</a>, which contained scones he and <a href=# title=Goh>Goh</a> had bought. Goh later lied to protect Scorbunny from the scone seller, claiming Scorbunny was his <a href=# title="Pokémon (species)">Pokémon</a>, though the scone seller immediately saw through his lies. After learning about Scorbunny's history, Goh told it that it should try to explore the <a href=# title="Pokémon world">world</a> beyond Wyndon. When Ash and Goh rushed to catch their train to the <a href=# title="Wild Area">Wild Area</a>, the Nickit carried Scorbunny to the train station and tossed it onto the train. At first, Scorbunny was hesitant, but when the Nickit assured it that they could take care of themselves now, it happily bid them farewell before rubbing the dirt off its body.</p><a href=# class=image><img alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/archives.bulbagarden.net/media/upload/thumb/8/86/Goh_choosing_Scorbunny.png/375px-Goh_choosing_Scorbunny.png decoding=async width=250 height=141 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> Scorbunny being picked to be Goh's first Pokémon<p>In <i><a href=# title=JN005>Mind-Boggling Dynamax!</a></i>, Scorbunny tried to catch Goh's attention aboard the train but failed. When Goh and Ash left the train at their stop, Scorbunny accidentally stayed on board before realizing what had happened and was forced to jump from the moving train later on and try to catch up to Goh on foot. After many hardships, it finally reached Goh and Ash and caughth their attention while they were examining a <a href=# title="Snorlax (Pokémon)">Snorlax</a>. Scorbunny expressed its willingness to become Goh's Pokémon, but Goh said he had already decided to make <a href=# title="Mew (Pokémon)">Mew</a> his first Pokémon. Suddenly, the Snorlax they had been examining <a href=# title=Gigantamax>Gigantamaxed</a> and blocked a nearby train track. With Scorbunny's help, Goh and Ash were able to make Snorlax move and prevented an incoming train from hitting it. Impressed by Scorbunny's abilities, Goh made it his first Pokémon instead of Mew. Although Goh's <a href=# title="Poké Ball (item)">Poké Ball</a> throw missed, Scorbunny hit it on its own and was successfully <a href=# title="Caught Pokémon">caught</a>. When Goh and Ash returned to the <a href=# title="Cerise Laboratory">Cerise Laboratory</a>, <a href=# title="Professor Cerise">Professor Cerise</a> was surprised to see Goh having caught a Pokémon.</p><h4><span class=mw-headline id=With_Goh>With Goh</span></h4><a href=# class=image><img alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/archives.bulbagarden.net/media/upload/thumb/7/79/Goh_and_Scorbunny_first_battle.png/375px-Goh_and_Scorbunny_first_battle.png decoding=async width=250 height=141 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> Scorbunny and Goh in their first battle<p>In <i><a href=# title=JN007>Serving Up the Flute Cup!</a></i>, Goh used Scorbunny in the <a href=# title="Battle Frontier Flute Cup">Battle Frontier Flute Cup</a>.

Like Scyther before it, Scorbunny was quickly defeated, thus eliminating Goh from the tournament.</p><p>In <i><a href=# title=JN017>Kicking It from Here Into Tomorrow!</a></i>, after being taunted by <a href=# title="Goh's Darmanitan">Goh's Darmanitan</a>, Scorbunny tried to use <a href=# title="Ember (move)">Ember</a>, only to fail. While Goh thought Scorbunny's current move set was enough, Scorbunny was determined to master the <a href=# title="Fire (type)">Fire-type</a> <a href=# title=Move>move</a>. During a <a href=# title="Pokémon battle">battle</a> against <a href=# title="Team Rocket trio">Team Rocket</a>, Scorbunny disobeyed Goh's order to use <a href=# title="Double Kick (move)">Double Kick</a> and instead tried to use Ember, but failed once again, leading to its defeat at the hands of Team Rocket's <a href=# title="Chewtle (Pokémon)">Chewtle</a>. When Goh later criticized Scorbunny for trying too hard, it ran off to train on its own. When Goh and Ash found it, it ran away again but accidentally bumped into Team Rocket. During the ensuing battle, Goh, having finally understood Scorbunny's passion to learn Ember, taught it how to use the move by kicking a pebble with heated-up feet. This worked, and in celebrating its newly mastered move, Scorbunny evolved into Raboot and sent Team Rocket blasting off again. However, instead of celebrating the victory with Goh, Raboot simply walked away from him.</p><p>In <i><a href=# title=JN022>Goodbye, Friend!</a></i>, while in <a href=# title="Littleroot Town">Littleroot Town</a>, Raboot stopped a pair of <a href=# title="Zigzagoon (Pokémon)">Zigzagoon</a> from stealing <a href=# title="Ash Ketchum">Ash</a>'s backpack. During their stay, Goh noticed that Raboot had been sneaking out at night, prompting him and Ash to follow it. They discovered that Raboot befriended the Zigzagoon and a <a href=# title="Lombre (Pokémon)">Lombre</a> and had been spending the nights giving them dance lessons. When Raboot struggled against a <a href=# title="Loudred (Pokémon)">Loudred</a> trio in a dance battle for territory, Goh, Ash, and Pikachu stepped in to provide a beat for Raboot and its friends to dance to, enabling them to win the battle. The next day, Goh decided to leave Raboot in Hoenn, believing that it would be happier with its new friends than with him. When Ash asked if Goh told Raboot first, Goh quickly regretted his decision. To his relief, Raboot had followed them onto the train. Afterward, Goh and Raboot settled their differences and reconciled.</p><p>In <i><a href=# title=JN036>Making Battles in the Sand!</a></i>, Goh used Raboot to battle against a wild <a href=# title="Goh's Flygon">Flygon</a> in <a href=# title="Mauville City">Mauville City</a>. With its sensitive ears, Raboot was able to sense Flygon moving under the sand and dodge its attacks. When Flygon switched to using <a href=# title="Draco Meteor (move)">Draco Meteor</a>, Goh had Raboot jump from one meteor to another and use one of them for a powerful Ember, which was enough to defeat Flygon, allowing Goh to catch it.</p><p>In <i><a href=# title=JN037>That New Old Gang of Mine!</a></i>, Raboot battled against <a href=# title="Kiawe's Turtonator">Kiawe's Turtonator</a>.

It even went as far as to cover itself with dirt to fit in with them. However, as a Scorbunny, it appeared to crave attention, as shown at the end of <i><a href=# title=JN005>Mind-Boggling Dynamax!</a></i>, where it got angry that <a href=# title="Professor Cerise's Yamper">Professor Cerise's Yamper</a> and <a href=# title="Ash's Pikachu">Ash's Pikachu</a> wouldn't pay attention to it, before going to its Trainer with a tear in its eye. Cinderace is an expert kicker who hates losing because it cares about its friends so much, especially its best friend and Trainer, <a href=# title=Goh>Goh</a>. As a Scorbunny, it was shown to be an energetic Pokémon that has difficulty sitting still and could be seen kicking the air when needed to stay in one place. Cinderace is loyal to Goh, though only after evolving into a Raboot, it often had trouble being open with its feelings. As a Scorbunny, It would often sit on his shoulders and give Goh hi-fives with one of its feet.</p><p>In <i><a href=# title=JN006>Working My Way Back to Mew!</a></i>, Scorbunny was revealed to have good hearing, being able to sense a <a href=# title="Pidgeotto (Pokémon)">Pidgeotto</a> perching itself on a treetop from far away. It was also revealed to be hasty and quick to act, chasing after the same Pidgeotto and causing it to fly away. Even while it was later told to control itself, it soon got in the way of Goh's attempts to catch a <a href=# title="Diglett (Pokémon)">Diglett</a>, making it burrow underground whenever it got close. While Goh and Scorbunny's approaches to catching Pokémon clashed in the beginning, they were able to work around them as they kept capturing more Pokémon.</p><a href=# class=image><img alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/archives.bulbagarden.net/media/upload/thumb/e/ee/Ash_Lucario_Goh_Cinderace.png/375px-Ash_Lucario_Goh_Cinderace.png decoding=async width=250 height=141 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> Cinderace and Lucario<p>As a Raboot, it became more aloof, and it seems to have grown emotionally distant to Goh, as seen when it did not celebrate their victory over Team Rocket with him. It also appears to have developed a greater interest in <a href=# title="Pokémon battle">Pokémon battles</a>. In <i><a href=# title=JN018>Destination: Coronation!</a></i>, Raboot was quick to put up a disinterested front while Goh watched <a href=# title="Ash Ketchum">Ash</a>'s battle with <a href=# title=Visquez>Visquez</a>. However, by the middle of the match, Raboot was watching the battle closely, and after Ash won, it seemed pleased. Despite this, it had composed itself again by the time Pikachu came to greet it. Raboot has grown to prefer keeping its emotions hidden; in <i><a href=# title=JN022>Goodbye, Friend!</a></i>, when it reconciled with Goh, it became embarrassed when Goh noticed it was smiling under its face covering. Raboot was shown to be a good dancer, using agile movements with its hands, feet, and ears to <a href=# class=extiw title=wp:Breakdancing>breakdance</a>, even accenting its movements with fire.</p><a href=# class=image><img alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/archives.bulbagarden.net/media/upload/thumb/a/a0/Goh_Cinderace_and_Inteleon.png/375px-Goh_Cinderace_and_Inteleon.png decoding=async width=250 height=141 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> Cinderace and Inteleon<p>After evolving into Cinderace, it seemed to have outgrown its emotional distance tendency.

The two seem to enjoy each other's company, with Cinderace sharing its food with Sobble and being able to calm Sobble down if it feels upset. After Sobble evolved into Drizzile, the energetic Cinderace didn't quite understand why it had become so lethargic and was even seen trying to drag Drizzile out of its cave with the best of intentions in mind. Once Drizzile evolved into Inteleon, Cinderace seems to have a sense of partnership and respect for Inteleon, evidenced by the manner Cinderace treats Inteleon once it comes out of the Poké Ball in <i><a href=# title=JNS03>The Arceus Chronicles (Part 3)</a></i>.</p><h3><span class=mw-headline id=Appearance>Appearance</span></h3><i>See also: <a href=# title=Dynamax>Dynamax</a></i><h3><span class=mw-headline id=Moves_used>Moves used</span></h3><table class=roundy><tbody readability=1.968085106383><tr readability=1.0387596899225><td><table><tbody><tr><td class=roundy><table class=roundy><tbody><tr><td><a href=# class=image><img alt="Goh Cinderace Quick Attack.png" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/archives.bulbagarden.net/media/upload/thumb/7/77/Goh_Cinderace_Quick_Attack.png/300px-Goh_Cinderace_Quick_Attack.png decoding=async width=200 height=113 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></td></tr><tr><td align=center>Using Quick Attack</td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table></td><td class=roundy></td></tr><tr readability=4><td colspan=2 class=roundy>A <b><span>†</span></b> shows that the move was used recently, unless all moves fit this case or there are fewer than five known moves.</td></tr></tbody></table><h4><span class=mw-headline id=Max_Moves_used><a href=# title="Max Move">Max Moves</a> used</span></h4><table class=roundy><tbody readability=2.8314606741573><tr readability=1.6778523489933><td><table><tbody readability=1><tr readability=2><td class=roundy><table class=roundy><tbody readability=1><tr><td><a href=# class=image><img alt="Goh Raboot Max Flare.png" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/archives.bulbagarden.net/media/upload/thumb/b/b1/Goh_Raboot_Max_Flare.png/300px-Goh_Raboot_Max_Flare.png decoding=async width=200 height=113 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></td></tr><tr readability=2><td align=center>Using Max Flare as a Raboot</td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table></td><td class=roundy></td></tr><tr readability=4><td colspan=2 class=roundy>A <b><span>†</span></b> shows that the move was used recently, unless all moves fit this case or there are fewer than five known moves.</td></tr></tbody></table><h4><span class=mw-headline id=Moves_improvised>Moves improvised</span></h4><table><tbody readability=33.093045411242><tr><th><span>Picture</span></th><th><span>First Used In</span></th><th><span>Moves Involved</span></th><th><span>Partnered With</span></th></tr><tr readability=0.23728813559322><td rowspan=2><a href=# class=image><img alt="Iron Tail Ember combo.png" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/archives.bulbagarden.net/media/upload/thumb/3/3d/Iron_Tail_Ember_combo.png/225px-Iron_Tail_Ember_combo.png decoding=async width=150 height=84 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></td><td><i><a href=# title=JN020>Dreams Are Made of These!</a></i></td><td><a href=# title="Ember (move)">Ember</a> and <a href=# title="Iron Tail (move)">Iron Tail</a></td><td><a href=# title="Ash's Pikachu">Ash's Pikachu</a></td></tr><tr readability=6.1948881789137><td colspan=3><b>Description:</b> A combination of Ember and Iron Tail.
