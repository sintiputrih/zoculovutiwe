And now, with Hootie and the Blowfish announcing a reunion tour, we can’t help but wonder how much this country rock star is actually worth.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/GettyImages-1047780810.jpg><h2>Rucker rose to fame with Hootie and the Blowfish</h2><p id=par-2_101>Rucker helped form <a href=#>the band</a> with friends during their freshman year of college back in 1986. The friends were attending school in Columbia, South Carolina, when they decided to get together and start playing cover songs. Surprisingly, nobody in the band was actually named Hootie — the band name stemmed from nicknames of some of the members. The group mostly played rock music with a poppy twist, and they released their first album in 1994. It was a major success; today, it’s one of the most-sold albums ever in the United States and has been certified platinum more than 20 times.</p><h2>Hootie and the Blowfish took a hiatus back in 2008</h2><p id=par-3_68>The band continued to produce successful music and were one of the most popular bands of the 1990s. They made hits such as, “Hold My Hand,” “Time,” and “Only Wanna Be With You.” They made music all the way up until 2008, but decided to take a hiatus so band members could pursue other avenues. Specifically, lead singer Rucker wanted to try out life as a solo musician.</p><h2>Rucker has seen success as a solo musician</h2><p id=par-4_93>Rucker turned from the pop-rock scene to the country scene toward the end of the 2000s, and it wasn’t long before he became a well-known country singer. At the time, it seemed like a risk — entering an entirely different genre of music without a successful band behind you would scare anyone. However, he instantly became even more of a household name. Songs such as “Alright” and “It Won’t Be Like This For Long” became popular in 2008, but it was Rucker’s cover of Wagon Wheel that spread like wildfire across the country.</p><h2>Today, Rucker is worth about $14 million</h2><p id=par-5_89>Rucker’s success in the music industry has earned him a net worth of <a href=#>an estimated</a> $14 million. Between his success with Hootie and the Blowfish and his success as a country artist, he’s learned a lot about the music industry and has navigated it to his advantage. His cover of “Wagon Wheel” won him <a href=#>a Grammy</a> in 2014, and he’s also won solo Country Music Association awards. Hootie and the Blowfish won the Grammy for Best New Artist in 1995 and took home best pop duo the same year.</p><h2>The band just announced a reunion tour</h2><p id=par-6_79>Much of Rucker’s success should be attributed to his college band, and he hasn’t forgotten about them. Hootie and the Blowfish <a href=#>announced a new tour</a> in December 2018 to commemorate the 25th anniversary of their debut album. The tour will kick off in Virginia Beach, Virginia in early 2019. Although the band spent many years apart, they’ve returned for their 25th year with brand new music and want to celebrate their own success as well as the fans’ support.</p><p id=par-7_8>Check out <a href=#>The Cheat Sheet</a> on Facebook!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGSxor7IrqpmqqWYuKa%2BjKGmqKyZmnqjuM6wnaKrmGLEsL7ToWWhrJ2hfA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./emma-grede-html.html><span>←</span><span>Emma Grede - Age, Family, Bio</span></a>
