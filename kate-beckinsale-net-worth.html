Authoritative sources estimate that Kate&nbsp; has been able to accumulate an estimated net worth of over $16 million during her career, which began in the early 1990s.</p><h3>Kate Beckinsale Net Worth $16 Million</h3><p>Following her parents – although her father died after a heart attack when she was just five – Kate also decided to try for a career and to earn her net worth in acting. She played in several movies, but initially her roles were actually minor, until in 1993 she had her first serious role in “Much Ado About Nothing” – another retelling of the comedy written by Shakespeare. This didn’t increase Beckinsale’s net worth very much, but gave her some experience in method acting.</p><p>After matriculating from Godolphin and Latymer School in west London, winning prizes for fiction and poetry, Kate attended Oxford University studying French and Russian literature, which included some time in France, and this was the time when she started to play more likely major roles for the first time. Perhaps unsurprisingly, Kate dropped out of college to concentrate on what was becoming a lucrative acting career, and after “Much Ado About Nothing” she could be seen in “Emma”, “Prince of Jutland” and “Cold Comfort Farm”, furthermore, she was involved in several projects associated with productions on radio, and made her stage debut as Nina in “The Seagull’ at the Theatre Royal, Bath, followed by a couple more plays, and a reading of Jane Austen’s “Emma” for an audio production, all adding steadily to her net worth.</p><p>In 1998 she moved to the US with partner Michael Sheene, and auditioned for roles in New York, appearing in “The Last Days of Disco<i></i>“, then in a TV production of “Through the Looking-Glass”<i></i> as Alice, which confirmed her arrival on the US acting scene, plus raising her net worth considerably.</p><p>Beckinsale further raised her net worth as well as her profile when she was cast in the action movie “Pearl Harbor” in 2001, followed by “Serendipity”. Subsequently she was seen in such noted projects as “Underworld” Evolution”, “Van Helsing” and “Contraband” directed by Baltasar Kormakur, so her net worth was certainly rising.</p><p>Most recently Kate appeared in “The Only Living Boy in New York”, and has now appeared in over 40 films, and several TV productions, as well as a number of stage plays, in all of which critics comment that she looks and sounds very comfortable, certainly praise for her talent and versatility, and which has helped to continually raise her net worth.</p><p>Concurrently, as a model Kate also made a successful career, which increased her net worth even more. She was the face of such brands as “Lux Shampoo”, “Gap Denim”, “Absolut Vodka”, “Diet Coke” and many others.</p><p>Talking about personal life, Beckinsale was in a long-time relationship with the actor <a href=#>Michael Sheen</a> – the couple met in 1995 and soon after that started to live together. <a href=#>Michael</a> and Kate have one daughter – Lily Mo Sheen, who was born in 1999. However, the two didn’t marry, even if Kate made the analogy with a book from library – if you keep it long enough at your house, you start to feel this is your book – that’s how she described her relationship with <a href=#>Michael Sheen</a>. The couple broke up in 2002.</p><p>During the filming of the movie “Underworld”, Kate started a relationship with <a href=#>Len Wiseman</a> – American screenwriter and film director who agreed to cast Becknsale’s ex-boyfriend in a new movie. After the filming was done, Kate married <a href=#>Len Wiseman</a>, but the couple both remained good friends with&nbsp; <a href=#>Sheen</a>. Quite possibly marriage to such a noted movie personality increased Kate Beckinsale’s worth as an actress, too, if it was needed. However, they divorced in 2016.</p><p>Kate is certainly a philanthropist too, having supported the British Heart Foundation for many years, following her father’s demise, as well as Epidermolysis Bullosa Medical Research Foundation, Habitat For Humanity, MediCinema, and the Entertainment Industry Foundation.</p>﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿<table readability=28.633061778683><tr><td>Full Name</td><td>Kate Beckinsale</td></tr><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>$16 Million</td></tr><tr><td>Date Of Birth</td><td>July 26, 1973</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Place Of Birth</td><td>Finsbury Park, London, United Kingdom</td></tr><tr><td>Height</td><td>5 ft 6 in (1.7 m)</td></tr><tr><td>Weight</td><td>119 pounds</td></tr><tr><td>Profession</td><td>English film actress</td></tr><tr readability=9><td>Education</td><td>Godolphin and Latymer School, Hammersmith, West London, Orange Tree Youth Theatre, New College, Oxford, Oxford Playhouse</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>British</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Spouse</td><td>Len Wiseman (m. 2004-2016)</td></tr><tr><td>Children</td><td>Lily Mo Sheen</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Parents</td><td>Richard Beckinsale, Judy Loe</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Siblings</td><td>Samantha Beckinsale (half-sister)</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Partner</td><td>Michael Sheen (1995-2003)</td></tr><tr readability=7><td>Nicknames</td><td>Kathryn Bailey Beckinsale , Kathrin Beckinsale , Kathryn Romany Beckinsale , Kathrin Romary "Kate" Beckinsale , Kathrin Romary Beckinsale</td></tr><tr readability=0.34042553191489><td>Facebook</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>https://www.facebook.com/KateBeckinsale</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.34146341463415><td>Twitter</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>https://twitter.com/katebeckinsale</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.32142857142857><td>Instagram</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>https://www.instagram.com/katebeckinsale/?hl=en</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.21052631578947><td>IMDB</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000295</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.23529411764706><td>Allmusic</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>https://www.allmusic.com/artist/kate-beckinsale-mn0002051824</a></td></tr><tr readability=6><td>Awards</td><td>Sitges - Catalan International Film Festival - Best Actress (1997), London Critics Circle - British Supporting Actress of the Year (1999, 2017), Spike Guys' Choice Awards (2012)</td></tr><tr readability=8><td>Nominations</td><td>Saturn Awards, MTV Movie Awards, Screen Actors Guild Awards, People's Choice Awards, Gotham Awards, Critics Choice Awards</td></tr><tr readability=7><td>Movies</td><td>Much Ado About Nothing (1993), The Last Days of Disco (1998), Shooting Fish (1997), Love & Friendship (2016), Underworld: Awakening (2012)</td></tr><tr readability=7><td>TV Shows</td><td>Devices and Desires (1991), One Against the Wind, Anna Lee (1993), Emma (1996), Through the Looking-Glass (1998)</td></tr></table><table class=quotes readability=36.323725834798><tr><th>#</th><th>Quote</th></tr><tr readability=3><td>1</td><td>I didn't go looking to marry an American, it just kinda happened like that.</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>2</td><td>We had something recently when there were about 16 people in front of us taking pictures and Lily was enjoying the chance to legitimately shout at some grownups because normally she's not allowed.
