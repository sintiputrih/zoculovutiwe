The crowd gave the young wrestler a standing ovation as soon as the official slapped the mat.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>In a </span><span>post-match interview</span><span>, Welch said, “After the semifinals, I was just ready. I made history by making the finals and I just wanted to win.”&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Welch, who lost to De Paz in the Class 3A Upper State championship the week before, won her weight class at the girls’ state wrestling championships in early February.</span></p><p><span>Kathleen Welch, the athlete’s mother, highlighted the significance of her daughter’s historic win.</span></p><p><span>“June broke a barrier,” she told </span><span>WSPA 7NEWS</span><span>. “She enabled other girls to realize that they might be able to do that.”</span></p><p><span>Woodruff coach John Harper said Welch was able to succeed no matter who her opponent was. In South Carolina, girls wrestling on the high school level has yet to be sanctioned, which is why Welch needed to compete with De Paz, a male wrestler, during the championship match.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>“It’s not anything that’s uncommon or daunting for her because she’s been doing it for so long,” Harper was quoted as saying. “She approaches each match as another opportunity to compete. It doesn’t matter if it’s a male or a female. She just enjoys wrestling.”</span></p><p><span>The spirited athlete, who started wrestling when she was in the fifth grade, has now set her sights on the national championships which will be held later this year.</span></p><p><span>Featured Image via </span><span>NEX GEN MEDIA LLC.</span></p><h3>Support our Journalism with a Contribution</h3><p>Many people might not know this, but despite our large and loyal following which we are immensely grateful for, NextShark is still a small bootstrapped startup that runs on no outside funding or loans.</p><p>Everything you see today is built on the backs of warriors who have sacrificed opportunities to help give Asians all over the world a bigger voice.</p><p>However, we still face many trials and tribulations in our industry, from figuring out the most sustainable business model for independent media companies to facing the current COVID-19 pandemic decimating advertising revenues across the board.</p><p>We hope you consider making a contribution so we can continue to provide you with quality content that informs, educates and inspires the Asian community.<br><span class=donate_way><strong>Even a $1 contribution goes a long way.</strong></span> Thank you for everyone’s support.
