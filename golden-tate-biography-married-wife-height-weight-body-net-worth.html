Tate III, the former Seattle Seahawks wide receiver was born to Golden Tate II and Yolanda Tate.&nbsp;It’s not hard to see where Tate inherited his sporting prowess from;&nbsp;like his father.&nbsp;Golden Tate II, also played college football as a wide receiver for Tennessee State University.</span></p><p><span>Tate was educated in high school at Pope John Paul II High School and showed off his various supporting talents at baseball, football, and track and field events.&nbsp;In track and field events, Tate was renowned for running short distances.&nbsp;He held the state record for the fastest 100 m and 200 m dash (10.93 s and 22.33 s).&nbsp;He also won the national title with his school in the 4 × 100 m relay races.&nbsp;In 2006, his impressive high school football stats earned him a first-team pick of the Tennessee Division II First Division Team.&nbsp;And to top it off, his jersey number was retired by the school in recognition of his excellent contribution to the game and to the school.</span></p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=golden-tate-career-%e2%80%93-baseball></span><strong><span>Golden Tate Career – Baseball</span></strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><span>Tate enrolled at the University of Notre Dame but not to play the football he played so well in high school, but to play baseball.&nbsp;He was tempted to continue playing football as an amateur and give up college when he was drafted by the Arizona Diamondbacks in the 2007 amateur draft, but he persisted with baseball.&nbsp;His freshman season saw him bat .262 with three doubles and three stolen bases in his 18 games.&nbsp;His playing time improved in his second season as he played a total of 55 games and scored 45 runs (a school record) with a .392 batting average.</span></p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=college-football></span><strong><span>college football</span></strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><span>Tate would continue to focus on football despite being drafted by the San Francisco Giants in the 2010 MLB Draft.&nbsp;He only started two games as a rookie for the Fighting Irish (Notre Dame’s football team).&nbsp;In his second season, his playing time increased and he started 12 games in which he scored 10 touchdowns with 58 catches for 1,080 yards.&nbsp;He helped the Irish Fighting defeat the Hawaii Warriors in the Hawaii Bowl.&nbsp;Golden Tate joined the first-team All-American in 2009 and also received the nod for the Biletnikoff Award in the same season.</span></p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=professional-career></span><strong><span>Professional career</span></strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><span>It’s not much of a surprise when in December 2009, Golden Tate opted to try his hand at professional football and forfeited his third year of college.&nbsp;he was selected by the Seattle Seahawks after declaring his availability for the 2010 NFL Draft. In the second round, the Seahawks rated him 60th overall in the draft and signed him to a 4-year contract worth $3.261 million.&nbsp;His standout season with the Seahawks came in 2013, when he capped a standout performance with a Super Bowl XLVIII victory over the Denver Broncos by beating their team 43-8 to the Broncos.</span></p><p><span>He left the Seahawks at the end of the 2013 season and signed with the Detriot Lions.&nbsp;Tate signed a five-year contract worth $31 million.</span></p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=golden-tate-siblings-parents></span><strong><span>Golden Tate siblings, parents</span></strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><span>As mentioned earlier, the case of Golden Tate further confirms the claim that an apple does not fall too far from the tree.&nbsp;He is not only his father’s son because they have the same name, he is also following in his father’s footsteps in his career.&nbsp;His father, Golden Tate II, also played college football and was also a wide receiver just like his son.&nbsp;He played for Tennessee State University and was selected by the Indianapolis Colts in the 5th round of the 1984 NFL Draft as the 120th overall pick.</span></p><p><span>His mother is Yolanda Tate and not much is known about her.&nbsp;Tate isn’t the only person to be an athlete in the family.&nbsp;he has a brother, Wesley Tate, who played at Vanderbilt University as a running back.</span></p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=married-life-%e2%80%93-woman></span><strong><span>Married Life – Woman</span></strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><span>Golden Tate is no longer on the singleMens bandwagon.&nbsp;He dropped his single status on March 11, 2017 and tied the knot with his girlfriend, Elise Pollard.&nbsp;The couple got engaged on September 12, 2015 in San Diego and waited two years before deciding to walk down the hallowed aisle with family and close friends in Cabo San Lucas, Mexico.&nbsp;Their family is already growing – on January 18, 2018, the couple welcomed their bundle of joy – a daughter, Londyn Marie Tate.</span></p><p><span>Elise Pollard is an account executive and director of business development at Harvey Nash, but before her it was known that Golden Tate was romantically involved with Ashton Meem, who was then married to Russel Wilson.&nbsp;Her alleged affair with Ashton led to the dissolution of their marriage.</span></p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=body-measurements-%e2%80%93-height-weight></span><strong><span>Body measurements – height, weight</span></strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><span>The Detriot Lions wide receiver has a fine physical body;&nbsp;one that most guys, including athletes, would give anything away.&nbsp;He is of medium height and stands 1.78 m (5 ft 10 in).&nbsp;His body weight is proportional to his height and it is measured at 89 kg (197 lb).&nbsp;However, his other body measurements are not known.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaJ%2BfobGmuoytmK2dXZe2sLPRmqehsV2irrO%2ByJ6bZq%2BZm7JutMSinqGsXayyqrPHrWSbp5Sueq%2Bx02auqKqknXw%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./matthew-perry-courteney-cox-was-beautiful-did-they-date.html><span>←</span><span>Courteney Cox was 'beautiful' did they date?</span></a>
