To some fans, she’ll forever be Willow Rosenberg from the cult classic show Buffy: The Vampire Slayer.&nbsp;To others, she’s the band camp love interest Michelle Flaherty from the&nbsp;American Pie&nbsp;films. For sitcom fans, she’ll always be Lily Aldrin from the coming of age series&nbsp;How I Met Your Mother.&nbsp;</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>More recently though, Alyson has joined another hit series:&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Dancing With The Stars.</a>&nbsp;She’s thrived on the show, and she’s competing in the season 32 finale with <strong>Sasha Farber. </strong>Throughout her journey on DWTS, she has had her husband&nbsp; <strong><a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Alexis Denisof</a>&nbsp;</strong>cheering her on. She shouted out how her hubby has been supporting her in an interview with&nbsp;People.&nbsp;“He’s been so supportive and I’m not surprised, but I’m super appreciative,” she said. “He’s always been a hands-on dad and he’s made so many sacrifices for us. But just the support and in every single way of, I’m home, but I’m lying on the couch, kind of like, ugh. And he’s everything. He cooks, [he] gets me ice. He’s everything. It’s amazing.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>Ahead of the season 32 finale, find out everything you need to know about Alexis here!</p><h2>How Did Alyson Meet Alexis?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/alyson-hannigan-husband-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-5>Alexis and <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Alyson</a> first crossed paths when he joined the cast of&nbsp;Buffy. While Alyson had been a cast member since the beginning, Alexis’ character Wesley Wyndham Price didn’t enter the show until the third season. The actress said that they experienced “flirtation at first sight” in a 2012 interview with&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>The Sun</a>.&nbsp;</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>Despite hitting it off, they each had other relationships before they eventually got together in 1999. She dated someone else, because he didn’t want to be involved with someone he worked with, and after he broke up from his relationship, they got together two years later.</p><h2>Alexis Is Also an Actor</h2><p id=content-paragraph-7>As should be clear from their meeting, Alexis is a fellow actor, who is very successful in his own rite. After Buffy, he continued acting in the spinoff series&nbsp;Angel,&nbsp;as Wesley. He’s also notably appeared in the Marvel Cinematic Universe as The Other in both&nbsp;The Avengers&nbsp;and&nbsp;The Guardians of the Galaxy.&nbsp;Other shows he’s appeared in include the&nbsp;Chilling Adventures of Sabrina, Finding Carter,&nbsp;and&nbsp;Grimm.&nbsp;</p><h2>They’ve Been Married Since 2003</h2><p id=content-paragraph-8>Alexis popped the question to Alyson in 2001. The&nbsp;American Pie&nbsp;star recalled his proposal in a 2012 interview with <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>People</a>.&nbsp;She said that they’d road-tripped out to her future husband’s mom’s house for the holidays when he popped the question during a pit stop for a bite. She revealed that he began making a beautiful speech as she was mid-bite. “The whole time I am getting kind of frustrated, like, ‘Why does he always do this? He says the most romantic things and it would be the perfect way to propose and then he doesn’t propose,'” she said. “But I knew he meant it because he had a ring.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-9>The pair said their “I do’s” two years later at an intimate ceremony in Palm Springs. Alyson revealed that she invited her&nbsp;American Pie&nbsp;castmate&nbsp;<strong>January Jones&nbsp;</strong>to the ceremony, and she was the only one. ” It was very small, so a lot of people got nixed. Jason Biggs gave me hell for not being invited,” she told&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Entertainment Weekly.</a></p><p id=content-paragraph-10>The couple renewed their vows 10 years later. Alyson tweeted her husband had an amazing surprise for her. “My hubby @AlexisDenisof surprised me with the most romantic day of my life yesterday! Which included another proposal & ring! I said YES!” she wrote on X (formerly Twitter) in July of that year. The pair had a ceremony to renew their vows that October, per&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>E! News.&nbsp;</a></p><h2>Besides ‘Buffy,’ Alexis Appeared Alongside Alyson in ‘How I Met Your Mother’</h2><p id=content-paragraph-11>While the couple met on the set of Buffy,&nbsp;Alexis did make a cameo appearance in the other hit TV series Alyson starred in:&nbsp;How I Met Your Mother. He played the fan-favorite Sandy Rivers for 10 episodes. While Sandy is most known as the co-anchor on a morning show who briefly dated Robin (played&nbsp;<strong>Cobie Smulders</strong>), his character did make quite a few appearances in later seasons.</p><p id=content-paragraph-12>In fact, Alexis reprised the role in the spinoff series&nbsp;How I Met Your Father&nbsp;on Hulu. While Alyson didn’t make an appearance, quite a few cast members from the original series made cameos throughout the show’s two seasons.</p><h2>They Have 2 Kids</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/alyson-hannigan-husband-family-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-13>Alyson and Alexis are also parents to two beautiful daughters! Alyson gave birth to her first baby,&nbsp;<strong>Satyana,&nbsp;</strong>14, on her birthday on March 24, 2009. The pair welcomed&nbsp;<strong>Keeva,&nbsp;</strong>11, in May 2012.</p><h2>What Has Alyson Said About Alexis?</h2><p id=content-paragraph-14>Alyson has spoken about her husband often in interviews and shared plenty of hilarious anecdotes about him over the years. The actress admitted that she misses him so much when he’s away for work in a 2020 interview with<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>&nbsp;</a><a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Us Weekly</a>.&nbsp;“We love being together and it just feels like part of my heart is gone when he’s gone. So, I’m very excited for him to come back,” she said.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme8ClsKynnmK1orrNop6apqNitba%2FwZqlnWWRoblurcGorK1lkaGyubXSZpueppmovKd5lGpuaWpgZnw%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./alexa-ray-joel-transformation-billy-joel-christie-brinkley-daughter-201424.html><span>←</span><span>Alexa Ray Joel's Transformation: See Billy Joel's Daughter Now!</span></a>
