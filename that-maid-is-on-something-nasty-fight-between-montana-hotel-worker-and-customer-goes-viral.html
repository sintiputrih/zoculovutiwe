The altercation reportedly started after a family repeatedly asked for an extra hour for checkout. In the now-viral video, the hotel's guest Jaylynn Mitchell was seen seeking special consideration for her disabled uncle.</p><p>Following the misunderstanding, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">according to Fox News</a>, the family was finally able to set up accommodations for the disabled relative. Mitchell claimed in her <a href=#>TikTok</a> video that at around 11:30 am, they heard a tap on the door. The hotel room was supposed to be cleaned by Kathryn Carrette, the housekeeper. After that, two staff employees and a number of family members got into a fight in the lobby.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>RELATED ARTICLES</strong></p><p><a href=#>Video of Hayden Panettiere and BF Brian Hickerson BRAWLING outside bar goes viral!</a></p><p><a href=#>Video captures woman hurling homophobic remarks before being removed from Dallas-bound flight</a></p><h2 class=split>What’s in the TikTok video?</h2><p>Mitchell took out her cell phone during the confrontation to record Kathryn Carrette, the housekeeper, and General Manager Kelli LaFountain's remarks. Charrette then shouted while using Mitchell’s indigenous accent, “I’m gonna put this on TikTok. I’m gonna put this on TikTok.”&nbsp;</p><p>Mitchell replied back saying, “See how she’s mocking our accent,” to which Carrette said, “Really? I was just talking.” Mitchell and another unidentified speaker behind the camera shouted at Charrette and turned their attention to LaFountain, who was gesturing to the phone to call the police. "Very disruptive guests in the lobby," she reported to the police. "He was supposed to be out at 11! That’s the whole point. I don’t care if he’s a quadriplegic,” Charrette is heard and seen yelling at someone down the hall while on the phone.&nbsp;</p><p>Moreover, the visitors could be heard yelling foul language at the two staff employees for their activities. In the footage, Charrette can be seen laughing inanely while pointing a middle finger in the direction of the camera. On camera, General Manager LaFountain was seen speaking to law enforcement on the phone.</p><p>After the altercation, Jaylynn Mitchell <a href=# rel=nofollow>uploaded the video on TikTok</a> with the caption, “I wonder why this “establishment” is a two-star hotel!! These women blatantly disrespected our whole family this morning! My uncle is a paraplegic and THEY STATED HE CAN CHECK OUT AT NOON! They shouldn’t go back on their word! Mind you the first lady who was yelling around was on the maid! It takes at least 3 of us to get our uncle ready and out of bed and into the care we were all there at 11:30 am and this is what we pulled up too was this woman yelling at my two uncles saying they needed to out by 11! I hope our tribe doesn’t support this awful place anymore!”</p><h2 class=split>'That maid is on something'</h2><p>More than 712,000 people viewed the TikTok post, and it received about 60,000 likes and more than 700 shares from viewers. Several people also came out and expressed their dissatisfaction with the situation. One person wrote in the comment section of Jaylynn Mitchell’s post, “wow” with an angry emoji. Another user added, “I think that maid is on something. I can’t imagine walking into a hotel and hearing one of their employees talking like this.”&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmillZbEuHrCqKRorJiWwW65wKKbZqGjYryvedKopJ6smJ67qHnNmqqtsV2btqi002aZnqynmrKvecyopa2ZnpZ6qbvTnqNmr5%2BnuKa%2BjJqlnWWTqsC1u8yeqWafn5rAbsLIq5il</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./pokemon-of-the-week-19-hoppip-skiploom-jumpluff-218999.html><span>←</span><span>Pokmon of the Week #19: Hoppip, Skiploom, &amp;amp; Jumpluff</span></a>
