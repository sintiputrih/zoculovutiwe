She forms a sync pair with Garchomp, which is capable of Mega Evolving.<h2>Does Cynthia have a Garchomp?</h2>As mentioned, Garchomp is also Cynthia's main Pokémon in the games, and has made an appearance in every game Cynthia can be battled.<h2>How strong is Cynthia?</h2>Her Pokémon are all very powerful, all of which are above level 60. However, her powerhouse is Garchomp, which has several powerful attacks that can take away a massive amount of health in one attack.<h2>Does Cynthia's Garchomp have a name?</h2>Cynthia's Garchomp from DPP is never officially called the "Almighty Garchomp" however most fans refer to it as such.<h2>Could Cynthia Become Champion in Galar? | Pokemon Sword</h2><p></p><h2>Does Cynthia have a rayquaza?</h2>Other. In Malice In Wonderland!, Cynthia appeared to own a Rayquaza, but it was only an illusion created by Mismagius. Whenever Mismagius fuses with Rayquaza, it becomes the same color as the Mismagius, making it look like a Shiny Rayquaza.<h2>How fast is Cynthia's Lucario?</h2>In BDSP, Cynthia's 'Chomp has an absurdly alarming Speed of 212, meaning it will outspeed almost every Pokémon in the Sinnoh Pokédex.<h2>Who is Cynthia's strongest Pokemon?</h2>As the signature Pokemon of Cynthia, it should be no surprise that her Garchomp is the strongest fighter in all of her teams.<h2>Is Cynthia hard to beat?</h2>Cynthia has a reputation for being one of the hardest Pokémon League Champion fights across all of the main series Pokémon games—and her appearance in Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl is no exception.<h2>Is Cynthia overpowered?</h2>All the Champions should be this tough. That's why Cynthia is on this list, but not at the top spot. Her Pokémon are unfairly overpowered, but they're meant to be.<h2>How old is Cynthia in Pokémon?</h2>How old is Cynthia? Cynthia is a 33-year-old from Twinleaf Town in the Sinnoh Region. Not much is known about her past but she clearly spent a lot of time with Pokemon since she is now the champion of the Sinnoh region.<h2>Who is stronger Alain or Cynthia?</h2>There's no way Alain's Charizard can defeat Cynthia's Garchomp, even after mega evolving. Cynthia's Garchomp would defeat Alain's Mega Charizard X too.<h2>Which trainer can beat Cynthia?</h2>To beat Cynthia, the first thing that trainers are going to need is Fairy coverage. Back in the day, Spiritomb had no weaknesses, and there was nothing that could hit Dark and Ghost for super-effective damage.<h2>What happens if I lose to Cynthia?</h2>There's no one correct strategy to take on Cynthia, especially when we bring different Pokémon to challenge the league. If you lose the first time, don't worry—just reload your save and try again. You can even take the loss, capture or grind the Pokémon you need to, and just rebattle the Elite Four.<h2>What level is Cynthia BDSP?</h2>Roserade: Cynthia's Roserade is level 60 Pokemon. It is a Grass/Poison Pokemon and you can counter it using Fire, Flying, and Ice types.<h2>Why does Cynthia have a Flame Orb on Milotic?</h2>Cynthia, though, has given all of her Pokemon beneficiary items to make them extra strong, including Milotic who now has a Flame Orb equipped.<h2>Does Ash battle Cynthia?</h2>PokeRaf's latest video he showed a recent interview with Cynthia's Japanese VA in which it was revealed Ash will battle Cynthia soon.<h2>Is Cynthia The hardest champion?</h2>Cynthia from Pokémon Diamond, Pearl and Platinum is often called one of the most difficult Champions of the series. Her team doesn't use any specific Pokémon type and instead features a well-balanced group of six Pokémon that wouldn't look out of place on the competitive scene.<h2>What are Tobias 6 Pokemon?</h2><p>Pokemon</p><ul><li>Darkrai. Darkrai was Tobias' main Pokémon. ...</li><li>Latios. Latios was first seen during Tobias' battle with Tom Norton where he fought Tom's Garchomp and Lucario. ...</li><li>Latias. Latias was first seen in a battle with Tom's Lucario. ...</li><li>Swampert. ...</li><li>Ninetales.</li></ul><h2>How many Pokemon does Cynthia have?</h2>Unlike the Elite Four before her, Cynthia has no real type preference, with her six Pokemon representing nine different types between them. Thankfully, the fact that all but one of them are dual-type Pokemon often makes hitting weakness a little easier.<h2>How strong is Cynthia Garchomp?</h2>Garchomp was Cynthia's most powerful Pokemon. She debuted in Top-Down Training, where she battled Lucian's Bronzong and won, blocking Flash Cannon with one of her fins and then defeating Bronzong with an incredibly powerful Giga Impact, which normally would not do much damage to a Steel type.<h2>Why is Leon stronger than Cynthia?</h2>Cynthia's Team Has More Type Coverage<p>This gives her more defensive coverage against opponents, as well as more Same Type Attack Bonuses to utilize offensively. Leon, on the other hand, has a team that accounts for either 7 or 8 of the types, depending on his team composition.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrTnqmvoZWsrrOxwGeaqKVfm66ye8KapWabqaPBqbXAZqSen5Fisre7y6%2Bc</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./who-is-aviem-sella-details-to-know-about-the-israeli-businessman.html><span>←</span><span>Who Is Aviem Sella?
