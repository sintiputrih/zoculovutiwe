The 27-year-old Canadian artist dives right into the juicy details about his romance with Rihanna with lines like these:</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>“You must remember wakin’ up in Paris with the blunt/You must remember fu**in’ me like anytime you want/What made us wanna act like we were married for two weeks?/ Now we’re back in California, we don’t even speak, that’s a no-no/ Everyone says we look good on paper, you deserve that action/Plus you get more paper than I do, that sh*t attractive.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>Wow! So much to unpack here. For starters, can you believe that Drake just revealed that he and Rihanna weren’t even on speaking terms&nbsp;not so long ago? Of course, she did just go to his NYC concert&nbsp;on Aug. 19 so we know that they’re back on at least somewhat good terms now.&nbsp;Perhaps this song was Drake’s Plan B to reach out to RiRi.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>By the way, in case you’re still having doubts about whether this song is really about Rihanna, just listen to Drake call out her two best friends, <strong>Jennifer Rosales</strong>&nbsp;and <strong>Melissa Forde</strong>, on the track: “Things that make me miss you, where Jen and Melissa?” It’s so obvious! Plus, immediately after that, Drake even plays an excerpt of Rihanna talking!&nbsp;(The line “Say Hi, M”.) Somebody is definitely still hung up on&nbsp;RiRi!</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>Canadian rapper <strong>E Batt</strong> also sings some verses&nbsp;on the track, but it’s being reported that he stole Drake’s unfinished version of “Views from the 6,” recorded over it and then leaked it to promote himself. So shocking!</p><h3>‘Views From The 6’ By Drake — Full Lyrics</h3><p id=content-paragraph-7>There are even MORE revealing, Rihanna-inspired rhymes to be found in “Views from the 6” — check out the full lyrics below:</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>[Verse 1: Drake]<br>You must remember wakin’ up in Paris with the blunt<br>You must remember fu**in’ me like anytime you want<br>What made us wanna act like we were married for two weeks?<br>Now we back in California, we don’t even speak<br>That’s a no no<br>Everyone said we look good on paper<br>You deserve that action<br>Plus you get more paper than I do, that sh*t attractive<br>Things that make me miss you, with Jen and Melissa<br>(Say Hi, M)<br>Tell the squad I said what up girl<br>Look at me, look at me, look at I<br>Ballin’ out, swear I use to be shy<br>Young ni**a<br>Back when I, was tryna’ make a, MI<br>My ni**a, when can I<br>How is this sh*t goin’ how it is<br>I always seem to kill it and yet everybody lives<br>I hope that they remember me, for everything I did<br>It’s some views from the 6<br>Just some views from the 6</p><p id=content-paragraph-9>So <strong>HollywoodLifers</strong>, do YOU think it was wrong for Drake to sing about “fu**ing” Rihanna in “Views from the 6”? What do you think of&nbsp;his new track?
