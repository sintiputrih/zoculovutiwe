According to legend, if you say the name Beetlejuice three times fast, the magical trickster himself will appear before you.Subsequently, question is, why is Beetlejuice spelled Betelgeuse in the movie? From Movieplot: This guy’s name may be pronounced as Beetlejuice, but it is actually written as “Betelgeuse” (named after the 9th brightest star in the night sky). The reason that director Tim Burton decided to title the film ‘Beetlejuice’ opposed to ‘Betelgeuse’ is actually very straight forward. Keeping this in view, what year did Beetlejuice die? Actor Glenn Shadix, perhaps best remembered for his portrayal of a portly, pretentious designer in the comedy “Beetlejuice,” died Sept. 7 at his home in Birmingham, Ala.What does saying Beetlejuice mean?Without giving the whole plot away, Michael Keaton plays a ghost named Beetlejuice, who is summoned and dismissed by saying his name three times. Beetlejuice. Beetlejuice. Beetlejuice. It’s also an intentional play on words, referring to Betelgeuse, a star in the constellation Orion, which is pronounced “Beetlejuice.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSesrSu1LOxZ5ufonuotI6wn7JllKSytHnBnpytpJWfwqqvxGaumqakYsawwYytpmarka56qbXSZqWapZVigG7AyKacrGc%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./who-is-mike-hughes-dating.html><span>←</span><span>Who is Mike Hughes Dating Now</span></a>
