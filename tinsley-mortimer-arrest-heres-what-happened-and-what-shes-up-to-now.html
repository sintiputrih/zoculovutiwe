Get a glimpse of her current life before diving deeper into the incident.</p><p>Mortimer, a well-known American socialite and television personality, gained fame through her participation in the reality TV series The Real Housewives of New York City and her appearance in the film High Society. She also worked with various brands, including Christian Dior, and has been featured in publications such as Vogue, WWD, and Harper’s Bazaar. Mortimer’s life is the subject of the Hulu documentary Queenmaker: The Making of an It Girl, revisiting her journey from adolescence to fame.</p><h2>Arrest and Charges</h2><p><strong>Mugshot:</strong> Tinsley Mortimer’s mugshot, taken during her arrest in Palm Beach, Florida, is still memorable. She was arrested for trespassing on her ex-boyfriend’s property, the Palm Beach home of Alexander Nico Fanjul. The police report revealed that she was found crying and yelling outside Nico’s house, where he was reportedly with another woman.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/newsnownigeria.ng/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Tinsley-Mortimer.jpg alt="Tinsley Mortimer" width=400 height=400 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Tinsley claimed she only wanted to retrieve her handbag from inside, but Nico denied having it. Earlier warnings for trespassing on his property had been issued in October 2015. Despite attempts to calm her down, she was arrested for trespassing after continuing to scream. Her arrest led to a memorable mugshot of her in disarray, a departure from her usual glamorous appearance.</p><h2>Current Whereabouts</h2><p>After the arrest, all charges against Tinsley Mortimer were dropped, and she has since stayed out of the public eye. Reportedly, she has relocated to Augusta, Georgia. Reality TV personality Sutton Stracke shared a selfie with Tinsley, indicating her move to Augusta on November 28, 2022. Tinsley maintains an Instagram account with over 687k followers, although she hasn’t posted anything since September 14, 2022, when she promoted the Nutrafol brand.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/newsnownigeria.ng/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Tinsley-Mortimer-2.jpg alt="Tinsley Mortimer" width=400 height=400 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Fans continue to express their well-wishes and check in on her through comments on her Instagram posts. Despite rumors of a potential return to television through Bravo’s Legacy series, Tinsley has not appeared in any TV programs. Currently leading a quiet life, her future plans remain uncertain, and more updates may follow soon.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlazAr7vWp6CgnaKerm%2B6xmiroqajobK6ecyoqa2hnZq%2Fbq3Rq5ysrF2dsrOx0mauoZmkYrWivM%2BepZ6cXZa7pXnWoZitZaOdsrR51Klkraddo7y4ew%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./shawn-johnson-net-worth-184339.html><span>←</span><span>Shawn Johnson Net Worth</span></a>
