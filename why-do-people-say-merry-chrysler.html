Some, though, use a rarer and more confusing phrase, "<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Merry Chrysler</a>," to greet one another. As the phrase has gained wider circulation in recent years, many want to better understand where it comes from.</p><p>As it turns out, the phrase was first created by a single woman in a video that was posted almost a decade ago. In the years since, the phrase has become more popular, even though the original video has become less well-known.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Why do people say 'Merry Chrysler'?</h2><p>The phrase originated in a Vine posted in 2015 by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Christine Sydelko</a>. Like many Vines, the video itself is relatively simple, with Christine saying a series of Christmas-adjacent phrases that are all broken in some way. She says "Merry Crimmas," "Merry Crisis," and "Merry Chrysler."</p><p>Of the phrases, "Merry Chrysler" is the one that ultimately took off and it's now widely used.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>When the video was first posted on Vine in 2015, it was viewed more than 100 million times, and even after Vine ceased the exist, the video continued to have a long cultural legacy. If you've ever seen a compilation of great vines, odds are that Vine was included. The platform may not have had a strong financial footing, but it still has a hold on the sense of humor for an entire generation.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">'Merry Chrysler' has outlived the original video.</h2><p>As sometimes happens with funny phrases, "Merry Chrysler" has become a little bit separated from the video that first coined the phrase. As a result, some people may use the phrase without fully understanding why they're doing so.</p><p>It has become a seasonal meme of sorts — one that shows up once a year during the holidays and confuses an entire group of people who have never seen the video it comes from.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"><p></p></figure><p>Christine Sydelko has continued to find success in the years since Vine, and has more than 1 million subscribers on YouTube. While the phrase "Merry Chrysler" may always be her biggest contribution to the broader culture, she has continued to make comedy videos and has a loyal following.</p><p>She built that following in large part through Vine, a platform that was well known for its emphasis on clever jokes, and a precursor to TikTok that had a much narrower appeal and focus. Vine videos could only be six seconds long, which meant that you had to think of a joke that could work in that fairly narrow timespan. Thankfully, "Merry Chrysler" was exactly that.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLW6ecOoZKmdn6W5pnnSmrBmpZWnv7p5wqGpsqucmr8%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./teal-style-card.html><span>←</span><span>Teal Style Card - Bulbapedia, the community-driven Pokmon encyclopedia</span></a>
