Some of this season’s most memorable scenes have involved Dustin and Kelsey, who appeared to <a href=#>share instant chemistry</a>, not to mention a mutual affinity for imbibing.</p><p>After Dustin received criticism on social media from viewers for his behavior, including a scene in which he said he would be open to cheating on Jaclyn, he posted an Instagram video explaining his side.&nbsp;</p><p>“I know a lot of you watched <i>Seven Year Switch </i>last night, and it was a lot of edited bulls–t, is what it was,” Dustin said. “They didn’t get out one full sentence that I had said, so let’s just get this clear. When I said I would be down for cheating, what that meant was, if I took this experiment 100 percent serious — [and] they were like, ‘Oh, take the experiment serious.’ [But] the experiment is f–king stupid.”</p><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/BPaOVksg23V/</p><p>“They take you to L.A. — they’re gonna give you tons of money to f–king go out there and live in a house,” continued the former MMA fighter, who lives in Pensacola, Florida.&nbsp;</p><span class=caption></span><p>“I’m not going to f–king sit there like a sheep and just f–king watch the world go by, and sit in that house with this f–king girl who wants to cry about her f–king husband not making her a good breakfast,” he said. “F–k that — I went and partied. Two weeks? Why the f–k not? If you don’t, you’re f–king sheep — I’m a lion.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/kelsey-and-dustin-sys-zoom-449ec06f-4852-4df3-9079-308ee7ddf1f1.jpg><p>In a later <a href=#>post</a>, Dustin slammed criticism that he drinks too much on the show: “Checked Twitter today, and a lot of people saying that I’m a f–king alcoholic. Guess what? I drink beer — thats what I f–king do. I took a look at your f–king profiles, I can tell a lot of you eat f–king fast food. I mean, you have fast food, I drink f–king beer. It’s what we do — we all have different lifestyles.”</p><p><b>Charles J. Orlando</b>, a relationship expert on <i>Switch</i>, tells <i>Us Weekly</i> exclusively that while the show is obviously edited, there is a limit to how much producers can affect Dustin’s footage, as they can’t “put words in his mouth.”</p><p>Tell <i>Us:</i> Do you think Dustin and Jaclyn will stay together on <i>Seven Year Switch</i>?</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p><i>Seven Year Switch</i>, produced by Kinetic Content, airs on FYI Tuesdays at 9 p.m. ET.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKqerpWjerqxwKtkrK%2BZqbCpv4ydrKysmaN6tLjApqpmnl2gtq%2BzjKyrrqiZmXq0tM6wZLBsZmh%2Fd4KO</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./lionel-messi-quotes.html><span>←</span><span>Lionel Messi Quotes That Define Great Inspirational Wisdom</span></a>
