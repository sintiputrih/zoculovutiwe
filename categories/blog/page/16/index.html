Intel has announced that it had discontinued its Xeon Phi 7200-series coprocessor cards codenamed Knights Landing.

The products in question are the Xeon Phi 7220A, 7220P and 7240P coprocessors, which were used for software development by various close partners of Intel, but were never released as commercial products (even though TYAN was ready to support Intel’s PCIe coprocessors).</article><nav class=main-nav><a class=prev href=../../../../categories/blog/page/15/>← Prev Page</a>
