But in June 2021, on Father’s Day, Kevin shared that his father died in 2005 at the age of 36 due to a heart attack. He added, “It makes me happy seeing other people post about their dads, especially the ones I know personally 🤗 I hope y’all have a good day with your dads!

They lived in a one-bedroom apartment for years.</p><p>Vera worked “three different jobs at once, went to adult school to get her GED, and did a bunch of other tough sh*ts.” He added in the Mother’s Day post, “Now, she has her own lit house that she always remodels (I still hate Glendora) and works from home every day to run her own successful business. my mom is the most hardworking and strongest person I know, and im so proud of her.
