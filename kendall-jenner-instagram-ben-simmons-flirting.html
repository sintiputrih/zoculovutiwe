He simply commented "Come here .." on her post. Surprisingly, Kendall, who has not publicly addressed their reported relationship, commented back with a race car and gust emojis suggesting to Ben (and the rest of the Internet) that she is ready to see him, and on her way over.</p><img alt="Text, Font, Line, Screenshot, Icon, " title="Text, Font, Line, Screenshot, Icon, " width=719 height=1280 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/thumbnail-img-1720-1547222140.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><a rel=noopener href=# class="pinterest css-esp0ot e1c1bym14"><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=auto width=auto alt=pinterest style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p><span class="css-5rd5i8 e1geg53v1">Instagram</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The pair has been tabloid fodder for a while now, thanks in part to their alleged on-and-off again relationship status.

"I'm not marrying anyone," she said. "I'm not engaged. There's nothing long-term or serious like that in my life. If I'm not fully, fully in it with someone, why would I make it public to everyone else? If I don't even know what it is, why would I let the world know?"</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">She also added that she believes relationships are "sacred." Jenner continued, "It's something between two people, and nobody else's opinion needs to be involved in it. People want to start drama. If I had a boyfriend, people are going to say all this stuff that's probably going to cause us to break up."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Fair enough. But, does publicly responding to Ben's flirty advances signal a potential shift in how Kendall is publicly approaching her love life? Perhaps, but until then, it looks like this is the closest thing we have to the duo going IG official.</p><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/play.db7c035.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=24 width=24 alt="Play Icon" role=img title=Play style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><img alt="preview for The Most Luxurious Gifts the Kardashian/Jenners Ever Gave" title="Video player poster image" width=2000 height=1000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/vidthumb/images/rec-00-01-31-02-still002-1541610454.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-3mrz81 ev8dhu51"><img src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/d513768d-85e7-45bd-84c7-b5cb68908a8d_1667322961.file?fill=1:1&resize=120:*" alt="Headshot of Nicole Saunders" title="Headshot of Nicole Saunders" width=100% height=100% decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p><a href=#>Nicole Saunders</a>is the beauty editor at Best Products with over seven years of experience researching, writing, and editing lifestyle content.
