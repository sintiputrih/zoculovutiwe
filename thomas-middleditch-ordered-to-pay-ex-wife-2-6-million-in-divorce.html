Although she will not receive spousal support, she kept her personal items that she owned before they wed and her car. He retained a house and a condo in L.A., a cabin in Big Bear Lake, California, a home in Canada, his residuals and royalties, his business entities and his car.</p><p>Middleditch confessed in April 2020 that he regretted divulging so much about his marriage. “To be honest, it’s a thing I wish I could take back. It was poor execution,” he said on The Daily Beast’s “The Last Laugh” podcast. “But I’ve learned to keep things a little more close to the chest. It was a painful [learning experience], to be honest.”</p><p>In March, a woman named Hannah Harding accused the Godzilla: King of the Monsters star of <a href=#>sexual misconduct</a>. In a report published by the&nbsp;<a href=#>Los Angeles Times</a>, she claimed that he groped her and another woman at a now-closed L.A. nightclub in 2019 and later sent her Instagram DMs in which he wrote, “I had no idea my actions were that weird for you. … I am so ashamed I made you uncomfortable.” Middleditch has yet to comment publicly on the allegations.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGatoJ%2BirrR5zKKbnaSVmba1r8dmpquclaeypXnTqGSpmalisrl51qKdnmViYoNuucilo6KnnmK2r3nDoq2oqpOafA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./sierra-ferrell.html><span>←</span><span>Sierra Ferrell - Vulture</span></a>
