It breaks our hearts to hear this news. Khalif was well-known on his own in the dance hall. Everything about this loss is bad. King Khalif Lawrence, the son of dancehall performer Aidonia and his wife Kimberly Megan, is said to have died of cancer after a long and brave battle with the disease. Last night, many people who use social media were in a lot of pain because they didn’t know that the couple’s only child was in a very bad way and fighting for his life.</p><p>When he was younger, Khalif was known for being outgoing and full of energy. But in recent years, he has stopped smiling in pictures, making it look like he is just a shell of the person he used to be. Aidonia has a lot of musical talent and has been around for a long time, but when he moved away from the dancehall scene, people made fun of him for being lazy, unreliable, and “losing his juice.” NO ONE KNEW THIS WAS FOR HIS SON. He was putting his life at risk to defend himself while we were making decisions about him. In the process, he gave up his job and his art.</p><h2>Your life and work</h2><p>Aidonia was born Sheldon Aitana Ricardo Lawrence in Kingston, Jamaica. He is the second child of a teacher mother and an ex-soldier father.

Aidonia decided to become a deejay after watching a tape of Sting 1993 with the fight between Beenie Man and his idol Bounty Killer.</p><p>He started acting out the fight for his classmates and friends, writing his own lyrics, and getting together with his friends to form the JAG1 (Jah A Guide) (JOP) crew.</p><p>After being kicked out, he moved with his father to the United States and got a job at FedEx. During the next three years, he went to Jamaica often and did a few “minor” things in the New York City dancehall scene. While he was in New York, some people told him to go back to Jamaica to get his career going.</p><p>He met Mr. G, who was known as Goofy at the time. In October 2003, he recorded his first single, “Many a Dem,” on Goofy’s Young Blood label. Soon after, he started working with Rod Pinnock of Orizen Entertainment.
