Yim joined the group as part of its feud with The Judgment Day in November. Styles went down with an ankle injury in December, and he <a href=#>recently returned</a> to the ring.</p><p>In an interview with Alex McCarthy for <a href=#>Inside The Ropes</a>, Styles was asked about the process of getting The O.C. back together. McCarthy noted that Styles was probably happy to be working with his friends again, and the former WWE Champion agreed.</p><p>“Absolutely,” Styles said. “I think that’s where we do the best business is when we’re together, and to have Michin, or Mia, whatever you guys want to call her, whatever WWE wants to call her, it works. It’s a good little family there. It all works, we all know each other so well, and Mia’s such a good extension to that family that we have. I think it’s awesome. I just would like to get it and do more. Not so less, but do more, and let’s get back to work.</p><p>Styles also highlighted Michin joining the O.C. and called her a perfect fit. He noted that she was the missing piece of the group, and he’s looking forward to doing more with her as part of the group.</p><p>“I don’t know exactly how it came around and who made the idea, but I can tell you, she is a great fit for us. She is perfect, like she was the missing piece. So I love her, man. Sweetheart of a girl, love having her on the team. She’s a great asset to The O.C. I’m looking forward to doing more stuff with her as far as that group is concerned.”</p><p>The video interview is available here:</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><p>At WWE Night of Champions, Styles will face Rollins in a match for the WWE World Heavyweight Championship.
