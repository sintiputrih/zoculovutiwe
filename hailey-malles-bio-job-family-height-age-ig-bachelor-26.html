She announced herself as a cast member of the Bachelor on 16 December on her Instagram with captions “The rumors are true…” followed by a rose emoji.</p><p>She also requested her followers to tune in to the show to “watch [her] take [her] chance on love”.&nbsp;The 26th season is set to premiere on 3 January 2022 on ABC.</p><p>Her bio on ABC’s website says “Hailey has a magnetic personality, is serious about finding love and won’t settle for someone who just looks perfect on paper.” Apparently, she is in search of a “family-oriented man”. She also wants her perfect man to have some career ambition and a “close relationship with God”.</p><p>Hailey wishes that her “dream man” would respect her for her personality and value her. She is a “firecracker” of a woman and he should not try to “soften” her.
