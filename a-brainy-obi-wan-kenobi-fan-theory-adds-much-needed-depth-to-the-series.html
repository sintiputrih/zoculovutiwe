Many people know of the George Lucas quote that “it’s like poetry, it rhymes” from his time writing the prequels, and it seems there’s even more poetry at work here.</p><p data-characters=151 data-current-count=151 data-injectable=false>Redditor /u/Totally-NotAMurderer has submitted their theory that the six parts of the series are meant to mirror the first six films of the franchise.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-reddit wp-block-embed-reddit" data-current-count=451 data-injectable=true><a href=#>[Kenobi] The show mirrors the movies</a> from <a href=#>FanTheories</a></figure><p data-characters=398 data-current-count=398 data-injectable=false>There’s some good evidence presented, and it harkens back to the<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"> famous Star Wars “Ring Theory</a>,” which proposes that the franchise uses ancient storytelling techniques to build loops of corresponding visual and thematic elements within and among its various stories. The ring theory often presents ideas very similar to this one, especially with regard to visuals being mirrored.</p><p data-characters=312 data-current-count=710 data-injectable=true>The ring theory extends well beyond the first six films in Star Wars, with the sequel trilogy also following a lot of the same ideas and borrowing visuals. As for this Kenobi theory, it can definitely be dismissed as just being coincidental, or reusing common storytelling tropes beyond the galaxy far, far away.</p><p data-characters=142 data-current-count=142 data-injectable=false>Regardless, it gives fans a new way to consume the series on future rewatches.
