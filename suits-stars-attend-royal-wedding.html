The actor plays leading man Harvey Specter in the US drama. He was joined by Meghan's on-screen husband <a class=hm-link href=#>Patrick J. Adams</a>. Fans of the show recently bid farewell to his character Mike Ross, after Mike tied the knot with Meghan's character Rachel in the season seven finale.</p><p id=ezYb0LfkIzzT><a class=hm-link href=#>This is what Meghan's on-screen flame Patrick J Adams is giving her as a wedding gift</a></p><figure class=videoPlayerClass_v1tejlff></figure><p id=eiY-XPCLjbi4 data-wc=87>When Harry and Meghan announced their engagement in November, the Canadian actor took to Instagram to pay a heartwarming tribute to his friend, branding the royal a "lucky man". Sharing a photo of Meghan in character as Rachel Zane, he said: "Playing Meghan’s television partner for the better part of a decade uniquely qualifies me to say this: Your Royal Highness, you are a lucky man and I know your long life together will be joyful, productive and hilarious. Meghan, so happy for you, friend.

Her appearance at the wedding comes shortly after she enjoyed a short trip to Paris before making her way to Windsor, clearly making the most of some time off. The 45-year-old actress is one of Meghan's closest work friends. She has previously been described by Meghan as "not just my Suits sister wife, but my sister". When asked about the royal romance, Sarah told the Associated Press: "I don't comment on my castmates' personal lives, but of course, it's very exciting. And I'm very happy for her."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/97038f18897f-sarah-rafferty-royal-wedding-z.jpg><p style=text-align:center id=eDbwPFJPwqe4 data-wc=9><strong>Sarah Rafferty kept it chic in a navy number</strong></p><p id=eVs53Yq5eXYS data-wc=118>Gina Torres, who stars as Jessica Pearson, looked fantastic as she made her way inside the chapel. She is known to have a close bond with Meghan. It was previously reported that she and her ex-husband Laurence Fishburne "double dated" with Meghan and Harry in Toronto. <a class=hm-link href=#>Rick Hoffman</a> made a dashing appearance. He recently thanked his fans for their support as he wrapped up filming Suits. "I'm checking in with you, just finishing up my portion of episode 804 and then heading East for some special event," he said. "I'm very excited about that and very excited about this season of Suits. I just wanted to tell you guys that I love you and thank you for your continued support.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/16cc4b4e44cc-gina-torres-royal-wedding-z.jpg><p style=text-align:center id=efNpXgoTRFE4 data-wc=8><strong>Gina Torres looked stunning in red and white</strong></p><p id=edNyLKSSUi5z data-wc=85>Abigail Spencer, who plays Scottie, made a sensational entrance.
