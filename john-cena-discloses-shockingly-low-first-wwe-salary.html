Since 2017, John Cena became a part-timer in WWE and has appeared sporadically due to his busy schedule in Hollywood. That said, it appears John Cena disclosed the shockingly low first contract he got with WWE.</p><p>In case you didn’t know, John Cena was not always interested in becoming a professional wrestler and certainly had a long journey ahead of him before he could realize his potential as a professional wrestler.</p><p>When John Cena debuted on the main roster in 2002, he was nothing more than a bland babyface who had no future prospects. In fact, Cena almost got fired during his first year in Vince McMahon’s company.</p><p>While speaking with&nbsp;<a href=#>Kevin Hart on Hart To Heart</a>, John Cena talked about signing with WWE in 2000. Cena revealed that he used to earn $12,000 a year for his first contract with the company.</p><p>“My first contract with WWE was $12,000 a year. I quit my job the day I was signed. I think my rent was $1,000 a month. So all my money is now rent. When I told my mom, she’s like, ‘I hope you’re okay.’ My dad, I could have told him any other position and he would have been like, ‘Yeah, whatever,’ but I told him I got a job with WWE. ‘Oh, my son. This is unreal. It’s going to great. I can’t believe it.’ Still, to this day, he’s extremely proud.”</p><p>John Cena also returned during the WWE Money In The Bank Premium Live event. We will have to wait and see when The Leader of Cenation will be making his return to WWE television once again.</p><p>What’s your view on what John Cena said? Are you surprised by it?
