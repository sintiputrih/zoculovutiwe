The actress is perhaps best known for her partnership with <strong>Quentin Tarantino</strong>, playing Mia Wallace in&nbsp;Pulp Fiction&nbsp;and The Bride in&nbsp;Kill Bill: Volume 1&nbsp;and&nbsp;2&nbsp;(2003, 2004). In real life, however, perhaps her favorite role is mom to three kids.</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>Uma famously dated actor&nbsp;<strong><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Ethan Hawke</a>&nbsp;</strong>after they met while filming the 1997 movie&nbsp;Gattaca&nbsp;and they got married in 1998. They welcomed two children,&nbsp;<strong>Maya&nbsp;</strong>and&nbsp;<strong>Levon&nbsp;</strong>before divorcing in 2005. Uma then welcomed another daughter,&nbsp;<strong>Luna</strong>, in 2012 with her former fiance, financier&nbsp;<strong>Arpad Busson</strong>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Uma-Thurman-Kids-Evergreen-SS-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-4>Uma attended the 2023 Cannes Film Festival and walked the red carpet on May 16, arriving to see <strong>Johnny Depp</strong>‘s new movie, Jeanne du Barry. Her son, Levon Thurman-Hawke, joined her. The 21-year-old looked just like his mother, with the same cheekbones and jawline. He also towered over his mother, which is no small feat since she’s 5’11.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>Uma wore a pale pink Dior Haute Couture ballgown with a Chopard choker that matched her red satin overcoat. Levon wore a navy tuxedo, which he paired with patent leather shoes that shone in the flash of the photographer’s cameras.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>Find out more about Uma’s kids, from the oldest to youngest below.</p><h2>Maya Hawke</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/maya-hawke-ss-embed1.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-7>Following in her mother’s footsteps is&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Maya Hawke</strong></a>, born July 8, 1998. After beginning her career modeling for various big names like&nbsp;Vogue, Calvin Klein, and AllSaints, she then made her on-screen debut in 2017 as Jo in the BBC adaptation of Little Women. Her breakout role, however, came as Robin — a worker at the mall’s Scoops Ahoy — in the third season of Stranger Things. She then went on to have a small part that same year in Tarantino’s&nbsp;Once Upon a Time in Hollywood&nbsp;— talk about&nbsp;really&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>following in mom’s footsteps</a>!</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>However, Levon has a role in a handful of projects that were listed in post-production/completed in early 2023. One of them was the <strong>Zoe Kravitz</strong>-directed <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Pussy Island</a>. “Frida is a young, clever, Los Angeles cocktail waitress who has her eyes set on the prize: philanthropist and tech mogul Slater King (<strong>Channing Tatum</strong>). When she skillfully maneuvers her way into King’s inner circle and ultimately an intimate gathering on his private island, she is ready for a journey of a lifetime. Despite the epic setting, beautiful people, ever-flowing champagne and late-night dance parties, Frida can sense that there’s more to this island than meets the eye. Something she can’t quite put her finger on. Something terrifying.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-9>In 2023, Maya became the latest starlet to appear in a <strong>Wes Anderson </strong>film, joining the ensemble cast of Asteroid City. She also joined her mother and <strong>Samuel L. Jackson </strong>in the <strong>Nicole Paone-</strong>directed The Kill Room. Maya also dipped her toes into the biopic world, playing Jamie Bernstein in 2023’s Maestro, Flannery O’Connor in Wildcat, and a “devoted Beatles fan” hoping to meet <strong>George Harrison </strong>in Revolver (a movie featuring her father, Ethan Hawke.)</p><p id=content-paragraph-10>In addition to continuing her acting career, Maya has also pursued a singing career, releasing <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>two singles</a> in 2019 and a debut album,&nbsp;Blush, in 2020.</p><h2>Levon Thurman-Hawke</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/levon-hawke-ss-embed1.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-11><strong>Levon Hawke</strong> was born in 2002. Levon is not only following in the footsteps of his famous actor parents but also his sister, as he joined the cast of&nbsp;Stranger Things&nbsp;for season 4. After <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>behind-the-scenes photos</a> were posted on social media ahead of the upcoming season in punk rock attire, rumors began to swirl about if Levon would appear on the show.</p><p id=content-paragraph-12>Maya eventually shot down the rumors. “My brother is not in the show!” she told <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>RadioTimes.com</a>. “He came to visit me. The COVID policies were really intense, as they should be, so the only way he could come to set was if he was dressed as an extra and did COVID testing. And that was a day that the paparazzi were there, so they got a picture of him, and it was all: ‘Nepotism strikes again!’ Guys, no! He’s not in the show, but you may potentially see him once, in one shot. So, calm down, internet!”</p><p id=content-paragraph-13>However, Levon has a role in a handful of projects that were listed in post-production/completed in early 2023.

He notably joined his mom in 2018 and 2019 on the front row of Prada’s resort shows in New York City and also the 2020 Dior couture show in Paris, reported <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Vogue&nbsp;</a><a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>India</a>.</p><h2>Luna Thurman-Busson</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/luna-busson-ss-embed1.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-15>Luna was born in 2012 when Uma was dating Apnad (the pair dated from 2007 to 2009 and were together again from 2011 to 2014). Uma likes to keep her youngest daughter somewhat way from the spotlight, as not much is known about the little one. Unfortunately, what the public may have heard about Luna the most during Uma and Arpad’s brutal custody battle a few years back.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/uma-thurman-daughter-luna-ss-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-16>The judge famously scolded the then-fighting couple for not being able to solve their issues, saying, “Reasonable people work these things out,” per <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Page Six</a>. Uma ultimately won primary custody in early 2017.
