That production will take place uptown at New York City Center Stage II, though that will not necessarily become Barrow Street’s new home.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjn4sgo3x00163a62esyshkp2@published data-word-count=124>Barrow Street Theatricals, as it is now called, previously produced and housed work such as Tribes, Our Town, and most recently, <a href=#>Sweeney Todd</a>, at their old home, the 199-seat Greenwich House Theater. Beginning in 2019, that space will be the home of Ars Nova (which has produced The Great Comet and KPOP, among other works). In the interim, <a href=#>Black Light</a> is currently playing there. Soleimanpour’s first play, <a href=#>White Rabbit Red Rabbit</a>, ran for nine months in New York in 2016. In Nassim, as in that play, a guest actor performs the work each night without rehearsal. They work off of materials enclosed in a sealed envelope, as dictated by the playwright. Performances will begin December 6 ahead of an official opening on December 12.</p><h3 class=related-title data-editable=title>Related</h3><ul class=related-links data-editable=relatedItems><li class=related-link><span class=svg-wrapper></span><a href=# data-track-type=article-link data-track-component-name=related data-track-page-uri=www.vulture.com/_pages/cji4sq62u00556iy6oledn3xz@published data-track-headline data-track-component-title=Related><span class=headline>All 41 Broadway Theaters, Ranked</span></a></li></ul><span class=ambrose-short-hed>Barrow Street Theatre Will Live On With a New Production</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t8HLrayrnV6YvK57kWlocWdhZXyjrdGrprBlo6m%2FprHTZquhnZGpv6Z5zZ6uZquglrCmec2apJ5mmKm6rQ%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./andre-3000-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Andr 3000 Net Worth Income Sources Besides Earning From Music</span></a>
