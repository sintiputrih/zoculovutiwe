The industry is filled with men who choose to have a brood of children: <a href=# class=text-word rel>Future</a>, Ol' Dirty Bastard, <a href=# class=text-word rel>DMX</a>, <a href=# class=text-word rel>Shawty Lo</a>, <a href=# class=text-word rel>Chief Keef</a>, and YoungBoy Never Broke Again, to name a few. During Johnson's recent visit to Club Shay Shay, he discussed why his name isn't included in conversations about entertainers with multiple baby mamas.</p><p>The former NFL star reportedly has eight children with seven women. Johnson and Sharelle Rosado welcomed their daughter just a little over a year ago, and as they plan their wedding, he says he's open to having more kids. “I think what people fail to realize is I was Nick Cannon before Nick Cannon," Johnson said. "I was Future before Future."</p><span><h6 class=has-small-font-size id=h-read-more-nick-cannon-alyssa-scott-welcome-daughter-his-12th-child>Read More: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Nick Cannon & Alyssa Scott Welcome Daughter, His 12th Child</a></h6></span><p>"Sometimes, I don’t get upset, but I’m like why they don’t ever lump me in," Johnson added. He speculated that he's not a hot topic because he's intimately involved in his children's lives.</p><p>“I’m so active with mine. You see me with mine all the time. All of ’em,” he further stated. “When we go somewhere we all go as one lil’ army so I’m never lumped into that category.” Johnson described his ability to balance fatherhood as having a "method to the madness." Cannon recently shared that he struggled because he isn't able to be there for all of his children the way he hoped.</p><span><h6 class=has-small-font-size>Read More: <a href=#>Akon Says He Supports Nick Cannon Having So Many Kids</a></h6></span><p>“But he’s doing it for a reason,” Johnson said. “My reason was during those times when I was younger, I wanted athletic children. So, therefore, I dated those who had an athletic background.” The sports great had regularly stated that when he looked for a partner, he also dug into their background to make sure they would be able to have athletic children.</p><p>There have been all sorts of rumors about why Cannon has decided to continue to expand his family. He <a href=# rel>welcomed his youngest child</a>, whom he shares with Alyssa Scott, in December. This is the couple's second. Their first baby, Zen, passed away from cancer complications in 2021.</p><p>[<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">via</a>]</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvTp5ywoJmltbC8jZympmdmZ4V0gI9mmqGZlGK3sLTNrKanZZSawaK1y6xkoZmmnruoecyuo62hoKGybrfInapmr5mptW6%2FxK%2Bcq5mcYsSwucSnZJudlqS%2FpnnNopqkZZOWu6%2B7zWamq2WWqsG2vsQ%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./jersey-shore-producer-admits-snooki-jwowws-note-sammi-sweetheart-idea-html.html><span>←</span><span>'Jersey Shore' Producer Admits 'Snooki' and 'JWoww's Note to Sammi 'Sweetheart' Was 'Their Idea'</span></a>
