Last February, the e-commerce site — which sells designer collections exclusively in sizes 10 to 22 — had Laverne Cox walk its runwayin a gorgeous Zac Posen gown. This time, it decided to switch things up a bit, throwing a cocktail party in collaboration with Good American.

I love 11 Honoré. I think what they're doing is so smart. Women need that access, and it's just discouraging and upsetting that it's so impossible to get these high-end designers in these sizes.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">When asked about tips for styling curvier shapes, Foster admits she doesn’t have any — for a good reason.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“With any woman, everybody's body shape is different, so I don't even think of it as ‘How does a curvy girl dress herself?’ I think of it as, ‘How does any woman dress herself?’ I have the body of an 11-year-old boy, so I dress myself a certain way. I'm very straight with no hips, and I have to do a lot of tricks even in my own styling, so it's really just about knowing your body. It’s a hard question to answer. I would have to answer it to a hundred different women to get that answer.”</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-square figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Sansho Scott/BFA.com</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_15-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">While there were plenty of stunning looks to been seen throughout the night, which included items from big names such as Carolina Herrera and Sally Lapointe, Foster had a specific one in mind for Graham, who is currently <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>pregnant with her first child</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_17-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“They have this one look by Juan Carlos Obando that I think is the most gorgeous look ever,” she admits. “It’s a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>blush silk trench</a> ($1,295) with a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel=nofollow>matching skirt</a> ($1,295), and I'm stealing it to try on Ashley tonight. I want to tie it above her bump and just have it be a really beautiful, chic look.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_21-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Her advice for styling a growing baby bump?</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_23-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“The main thing is to 100 percent be comfortable,” she says. “Your baby's happiest when you're comfortable. Ashley is at the stage now where she's showing quite a bit, so form-fitting is always good. I wore a ton of form-fitting stuff while I was pregnant, and I don't do that in my day-to-day life. It’s also always good to have those basics and then start getting into different things like accessories, shoes that are more fun, and cropped jackets that you can wear that will really show that you're pregnant. Because if you start to try to hide your bump, you're just going to look like one big sack, basically. I'm all about accentuating the bump.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57xZqqoaGfo3yxuNSsZKyhqpp6p63SoaCopl2ptrG%2FjGpoZqCfo7yzsYynsJ%2BvXaiyscDEppmeql1nfXKF</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./the-meaning-behind-the-song-i-know-you-do-unplugged-in-nashville-by-tyler-rich.html><span>←</span><span>The Meaning Behind The Song: I Know You Do (Unplugged In Nashville) by Tyler Rich</span></a>
