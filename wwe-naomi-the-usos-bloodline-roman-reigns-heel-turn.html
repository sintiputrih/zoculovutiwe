The Usos are the SmackDown Tag Team champions and Reigns is the Undisputed WWE champion.</p><p>Naomi is findings success with Sasha Banks right now, but could she turn to the dark side and join up with her family one day? Speaking to talkSPORT, The Glow explained that she wouldn’t just join them for no reason.</p><p>“I’m not opposed to it and I think it’s so important in our business to grow and evolve, but, if it ain’t there organically, then I don’t want it,” Naomi said.&nbsp;</p><p>“I don’t want it to be something for the sake of doing it. Or like ‘OK, we’ve seen her in the Glow, for this long, let’s just go heel to see something different!’ I really do believe in it evolving naturally.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talksport.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2022/05/The-Bloodline-1e65.jpg><p>“It definitely works, but just right now, there has to be a way to get me there. Because I’m so not affiliated with them on the show right now, you know what I mean? [laughs]. And they’re killing it. The faction is incredible, they’re killing it right now. If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it,” Naomi said.</p><p>Naomi has the benefit of gaining the Paul Heyman wisdom backstage hanging around her husband and she admits it’s a little strange she’s not in The Bloodline sometimes.</p><p>“It is a little weird that I’m not in it because I’m always there with them. Like I’m always there, I’m always around, I’m always annoying them [laughs].&nbsp;</p><p>“So, maybe down the road. Maybe there’s somewhere for me to come in with the boys Jon (Jimmy) and Josh (Jey), who knows. But it’s definitely something I would look forward to, I would just want it to be the right time and done properly.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talksport.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2020/09/Nao.png><p>Naomi has been on WWE’s main roster since 2012 and is a two-time SmackDown Women’s champion.</p><p>With The Usos and Reigns in the midst of a career-defining run, adding another star like Naomi could add another dimension to the stable and the women’s division as a whole.</p><p><strong>Make sure to get your tickets for WWE’s Clash at the Castle on September 3.
