After Drake posted a photo mocking the ink, Graham commented that since first getting the piece back in 2017, he'd had "16 people" try and fix the wonky tattoo. "They're hurting me," he added. Despite now having 17 different artists contribute, the original credit still goes to Money Mike, who did the original, and Mike is not too happy about being put on blast by Drake and his dad.</p><p dir=ltr>He explained to <a href=#>TMZ</a> that he did the piece for free, hoping it would lead to some publicity, but Graham wanted to cut the job short. "Four hours into the tattoo he was in severe pain and he was telling me basically just to wrap it up," Mike said of feeling rushed. Mike isn't holding a grudge against Graham, though. He places the blame squarely on Drake. He claimed Graham loved the tattoo until Drake first saw it and dissed it, forcing Graham to apologize on his son's behalf. The worst part? Mike thinks Drake burned some bridges in the tattoo world by pushing his father to get other artists to cover up Mike's work. "It's kind of an unspoken rule," he explained.</p><p>It makes sense Drake would want his dad to have a good tattoo, as he's something of a connoisseur himself, per <a href=#>Men's Health</a>. The rapper has at least 35 tattoos, including a tattoo of Graham and a portrait of Denzel Washington.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmcm1pbYZ0e8OrmKSdXaGur7DSZqCnZaWjuaq3xKWwZpyilrqiecCfq56qXai1orDIp55mq5Whs268zqurq5mZqXq1rdOtpqhn</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./who-is-candelabra-on-the-masked-singer-season-10-clues-and-guesses-for-celebs-identity.html><span>←</span><span>Who is Candelabra on The Masked Singer Season 10?
