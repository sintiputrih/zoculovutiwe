Morrissey in IMPACT Wrestling.</p><p>Monday’s episode of&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener>Busted Open Radio</a>&nbsp;featured Jordynne Grace as a guest, and co-host Tommy&nbsp;Dreamer noted that Grace had some creative plans for a tag team run with W. Morrissey. Grace and Morrissey worked together at IMPACT’s Rebellion pay-per-view, but Grace said she wanted it to be an extended run that ultimately saw them win the IMPACT World Tag Team Championship.</p><p>“I literally was so excited about teaming with Morrissey. I actually — the idea for our finisher was my idea and I loved it, I thought it was going to be an amazing finisher for us. I truly think that we could have won the [IMPACT Wrestling World] tag titles, to be completely honest with you. We had the finisher, I was going to get a jeans singlet made,” Grace explained. “I was going to start training in Timberlands so I could wear them in the ring. I was ready for this. I was so disappointed when he left.”</p><p>Later in the show, Dreamer said “William & Grace” was one of the team names Jordynne came up with, noting that she also had some t-shirt designs in mind too.</p><p>Grace and Morrissey teamed in the&nbsp;Tag Team Title Elimination Challenge at Rebellion, and once more in a Digital Media Championship match in April.&nbsp;<a href=#>Morrissey left IMPACT at the end of May</a>, with his last appearance coming on the June 4 episode of the company’s AXS show.</p><p>Grace went on to say that she wants to be the first wrestler to win every title in IMPACT, noting she needs to win the IMPACT World Championship, the [men’s] World Tag Team Championship and the X Division Championship to accomplish that goal. Asked who else she’d want to tag with to get the tag belts now that Morrissey has left, Grace named Rhyno as someone she’d like to work with.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uL7ErKulnaqku6Z6wqikaKaVrMBwfZJpaG1rZ2K3sL7DsqWnnV2cv6KvxGarmp9dqbKiuYyrrKdlp2K6sL7Roqqsnak%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./botched-executions.html><span>←</span><span>Inside 9 Of The Most Disturbingly Botched Executions In History</span></a>
