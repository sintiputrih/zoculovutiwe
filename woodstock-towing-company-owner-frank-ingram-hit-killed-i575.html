That's the first reaction. I get really angry," Roper said.&nbsp;</p><p>"Ingram's death marks the 34th since January first for responders (hit and killed on roadways) nationwide.

The law is meant to keep officers AND traffic violators safe from crashes with passing cars.</p><p>The Move Over Law was passed in the aftermath of growing numbers of police, emergency technicians and Department of Transportation workers being killed during routine traffic stops, crash responses and highway construction projects around the nation.&nbsp;</p><p>Currently, more than 30 states have Move Over Laws on the books, with fines that range as high as a thousand dollars or more in some jurisdictions. The Move Over fine in Georgia can be up to $500.</p><p>National Move Over Day is on Saturday, October 21. It's a day to bring awareness to the law.&nbsp;</p><p>As of Thursday night, Woodstock Police didn't release any information on the driver who hit and killed Ingram or mention if charges would be filed.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7cn3ApaCvnV6YvK57wKuropucmnyvsdasZqWnk5a5cMPOqJusrJ%2BYuG7AzrCgp59dmLyuvMCnsGanp6Oys3nFq5ino12eu6i%2BwKZkoaGkYriquMuem2ahZWyCcISUZmlvbZRtfXqxjGxtcXBdaYGlhIxxnWmcXZqDcbGVcJ1yaGFnfw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./leila-rahimi.html><span>←</span><span>Who is sports journalist, Leila Rahima currently dating?</span></a>
