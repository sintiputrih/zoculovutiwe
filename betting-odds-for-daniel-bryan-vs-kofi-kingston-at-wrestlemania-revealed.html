When you combine those two elements, it’s impossible not to imagine this being a barnburner of a match this Sunday.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"></figure><p>Kofi fans will be happy to learn that the man himself is indeed the favourite to become a World Champion for the first time in his career, with odds of 1/3. Bryan is the 9/4 underdog to retain his belt against the New Day member.</p><p>Both men have big match experience, but in a way, nothing they’ve done in the past can really compare to this. Bryan had his big moment at WrestleMania 30 when he won the WWE World Heavyweight Championship, but this storyline has really helped him to prove what he can do outside the constraints of a babyface role.</p><p>Things are probably going to keep developing into the next few pay per views after WrestleMania between these two men, and if that’s the case, we couldn’t be happier.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7XNoKqinJWjsri%2FjZympmdiZX56e49tZmltX5eytcDIp55mp5SZwG6yzqtknZmenrKtecGrsJqmXavAbrfOn6Bmo5mjtLTAzqdkmqxdrL%2Bmv9OlnKaZnp6ubr7Er5yapJWZfA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./who-is-jake-on-fire-country.html><span>←</span><span>Who is Jake Crawford on Fire Country?</span></a>
