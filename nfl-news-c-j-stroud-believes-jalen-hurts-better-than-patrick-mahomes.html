Stroud BOLDLY believes Jalen Hurts is a better QB than Super Bowl winner Patrick Mahomes</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>The Houston Texans finally found their potential franchise quarterback as they drafted the Ohio State QB<strong> C.J. Stroud</strong> as the second-overall pick in the 2023 NFL Draft. After many speculations about the possibility of the Texans trading down, they stood firm on their position and selected Stroud to be their future franchise signal-caller.</p><p>Stroud is currently participating in the OTA’s and taking first-team reps with his new<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"> Texans </a>teammates. The talented quarterback is expected to start for the Houston-based football team in week 1 of the 2023 regular season. Amidst this, C.J. Stroud has gotten off to a bad start with some fanbases with his NFL QB ranking list.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><p>Stroud recently revealed his top 5 NFL quarterbacks list that is missing some notable names and the rankings seems a little off. In his QB rankings, C.J. Stroud included <strong>Jalen Hurts</strong>, <strong>Patrick Mahomes</strong>, <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Joe Burrow</a></strong>, <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Josh Allen</a></strong>, and <strong>Justin Fields</strong> in that particular order. His rankings pissed off a lot of people, especially the Kansas City Chiefs fanbase since he rated the Philadelphia Eagles QB Hurts higher than the 2-time league MVP QB Mahomes.</p><p>The 2022 league MVP QB<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"> Patrick Mahomes</a> is already in the conversation for the top 5 greatest quarterbacks of all time. So, the Chiefs fans found it disrespectful after C.J. Stroud rated <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Jalen Hurts</a>, who has one good season in his career so far higher than Mahomes.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p>Furthermore, the Texans QB, including <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Justin Fields</a> in the list, but leaving out guys like<strong> Aaron Rodgers</strong>, <strong>Justin Herbert</strong>, and <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Trevor Lawrence</a></strong> also did not sit well with many people. The <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Chicago Bears</a> QB is yet to have a remarkable season in his NFL career, but Herbert and Lawrence already have proven that they could lead an NFL franchise.</p><p><strong>Related:</strong> <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Brittany Williams subtly CONFIRMS Josh Allen ‘cheating’ on her with actress Hailee Steinfeld</a></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-will-c-j-stroud-start-for-the-texans-in-week-1-of-the-2023-season><strong>Will C.J. Stroud start for the Texans in week 1 of the 2023 season?</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/firstsportz.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/C.J.-Stroud-Getty-Images-1024x768.jpg><p>Despite a lot of negative reports about C.J. Stroud ahead of the 2023 NFL Draft, the Houston Texans put their firm trust in the Ohio State quarterback and drafted him in the first round. Now will they start him as soon as week 1 of the upcoming season or will they wait for him to learn the playbook before throwing him into the fire?</p><p>Stroud is a prototypical NFL QB with pure pocket passing ability and great accuracy. The Ohio State product shouldn’t have any problem adjusting to the pace of the NFL in a quick time.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p>Besides, the Texans currently don’t have any great veteran quarterbacks that Stroud can sit behind and learn from. So, it’s highly likely the Houston-based franchise will start <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">C.J. Stroud </a>as soon as week 1 of the upcoming season.</p><p><strong>Do follow us on:&nbsp;</strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Facebook&nbsp;</a>|&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Instagram</a>&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Twitter</a></p><p><strong>In case you missed it!</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiemafAtb%2FPqKmtsl6YvK57zZ%2BjZqaVrMBur4yjZKysoqTCpXnBnqOinaaawG62wKWcp2WYqr%2B1v4ybnK2slad6tbTAp2SpmaSntqS3jKaYoaedmsBw</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./mallard-creek-bbq-returns-shifts-drive-thru-carry-out-only.html><span>←</span><span>Mallard Creek Church BBQ returns after pandemic hiatus WSOC TV</span></a>
