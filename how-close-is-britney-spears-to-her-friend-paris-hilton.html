The two appeared to have formed a close bond as they enjoyed their weekends at some of the hottest parties in the city while being chased down by dozens of photographers, eager to catch a snap of the two blondes together.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>At the time, Hilton was enjoying the success of her hit series The Simple Life, which had quite literally turned her into an overnight sensation while Spears had been caught up in plenty of love life drama as the media villainized the mother of two by claiming she was spending more time partying than taking care of her children.</p><p>Little needs to be said about the harsh and cruel ways in which the press would attack Spears for enjoying a night out with friends. Anything the “Lucky” singer did was heavily judged, so it was good to see that the singer felt she could let her hair down around Hilton — regardless of what people were going to say or write about her.</p><p>Given how hard it must have been to find people with genuine intentions in Hollywood, it seemed as if Hilton ticked all the right boxes for the A-list celebrity, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">given how they were always together for a long period of time</a> before Spears was thrown into her 2008 conservatorship.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=is-britney-spears-still-friends-with-paris-hilton>Is Britney Spears Still Friends With Paris Hilton?</h2><p>In an interview with Entertainment Tonight back in May 2021, the heiress shared that while she hadn’t been seen with Spears in a very long time, they were actually still on good terms and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">had just been texting each other the week prior</a>.</p><p>When asked about her relationship with the “Toxic” star, the 40-year-old gushed, "I love her. I was actually texting her last week, and she's just so sweet and down to earth and really an amazing woman. I'm so proud of her."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Miley Cyrus Showcases ‘Free Britney’ Screen At Lollapalooza Set</a></span></p><p>Hilton has been very vocal about Spears’ conservatorship, telling The Sunday Times in August 2020 that she’s devastated and heartbroken after learning the great lengths and measures people in the singer’s team have gone to gain control not only of the singer but also her multi-million-dollar estate.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Spears recently revealed in a court hearing regarding her conservatorship how she was forced to enter a mental health facility against her will unless she wanted to be punished by not being able to see her children Sean and Jayden. She also made claims against her dad, Jamie Spears, saying that she wants to sue him for conservatorship abuse.</p><p>Supposedly, he’s been the mastermind behind the miserable life Spears has lived for the past 13 years by making her perform, record music, and work extremely hard while she gets a measly $2,000-a-week allowance, yet her father generates over $18,000 a month.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Fans Think Britney Spears Didn’t Agree To Post Topless Video On Instagram</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>On top of that, Spears claimed she’d been drugged on multiple occasions and was relieved after her previous doctor Dr. Timothy Benson passed away since he had been providing her with a substance that was making her feel “drunk” and drowsy. In an Instagram post from July 2021, Hilton said she would always have her friend’s back and hoped that the ordeal with the singer’s conservatorship will end sooner rather than later so that Spears can finally live her life as a free woman again.</p><p>"I will always support and love Britney. She is so kind and sweet, and she deserves her freedom. I've been saying #FreeBritney for a long time, and I will keep saying it until she is free,” she wrote. "We all need to use our voices to protect victims of abuse. She is so incredibly brave and an inspiration for speaking her truth.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Fans Say Cardi B & Britney Spears Have This In Common</a></span></p><p>“I know personally how hard it is to come forward to tell your story, and so I hope Britney knows that she is so loved and supported by the world right now."</p><p>Regarding where her friendship with Spears stands today, Hilton insists the two are still close. In fact, she shared that the pair even had dinner in Malibu this summer and are regularly texting and phoning one another, giving the impression that the “Everytime” songstress is slowly but surely able to gain control of her life again.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The 39-year-old <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">was granted the right to hire her own lawyer</a>, Mathew Rosengart, last month, who is actively fighting to end the conservatorship as quickly as possible. The famous attorney has since argued that if Jamie had no ill intentions over his daughter, he would have already done what’s best for Spears and remove himself as her conservator — but he hasn’t.</p><p>Rosengart’s team will also run an audit to find out where all of Spears’ money has been going over the years and why her fortune has slummed to a measly $60 million.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Britney Spears Uses Paints To Let Out Her Emotions</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGifqK9dmLmwv8RmoKxlkqe2tbrEsmSsqJWWv7R506hkoZ2iYrOztcSnm2aokae2tHnHoqOtp55k</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./sixtyforce.html><span>←</span><span>Download sixtyforce for Mac - Free</span></a>
