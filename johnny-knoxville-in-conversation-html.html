What made you want to get back to that with <span class="clay-annotated kiln-phrase" aria-describedby=annotation-1 tabindex=0>Action Point</span>? Getting older can’t make the prospect of physical pain any easier to deal with.</strong><br>God help me, I love stunts. But after this one, which I got hurt on more than any film I’ve done, I started to think, Why do I love it? Am I addicted to it? Is it coming from a good place? I don’t want to overthink things, but I don’t want to underthink them either because in this line of work you only get so many chances.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjhgulk4m002l3b60ynfg7p6r@published data-word-count=63><strong>Did you land on some good middle-ground thinking then?</strong><strong><br></strong>I’m in the thick of mulling it all over. I do love the idea of an actor really doing his stunts with no cuts in the action. That adds so much energy and immediacy to a film. Some other actors do their own stunts, but the difference is that their stunts are designed to succeed.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjhgulk4m002m3b60lyq0v5ch@published data-word-count=57><strong>And yours are designed to fail?</strong><strong><br></strong>Yeah, that’s the only way mine are designed. I still get scared to do them beforehand, but I can override that fear. Maybe it’s not so good that the producer side of me convinces the performer side that we need the footage. Yeah, it’s also — my mom passed in the fall.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjhgulk4m002n3b60qnj0phyf@published data-word-count=37><strong>I’m sorry to hear that.</strong><strong><br></strong>That’s okay.

I always know I can get to the ramp, per se, but after that, I don’t know what’ll happen. And thinking about that made me fearful of making <span class="clay-annotated kiln-phrase" aria-describedby=annotation-2 tabindex=0>my children feel like I felt about my mom</span> when I knew I was going to lose her.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjhgulk4n002r3b60c7rj59fa@published data-word-count=87><strong>You were still in the middle of filming Action Point when things were going south with your mom?</strong><br>Yeah, we were.<strong> </strong>I had a fall and I knocked out three of my teeth and I got a concussion — my fourth concussion of the film. It made me think about how on one hand I love what I do, but I also realized that at some point I’m not gonna be able to do it anymore. And when that time comes I want it to be my choice.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjhgulk4o002s3b60avqzhs9d@published data-word-count=21><strong>So Action Point is probably the last time you’ll do a bunch of stunts in a movie?</strong><br>I — I don’t know.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjhgulk4o002t3b60hzf5pljd@published data-word-count=29><strong>It’s hard to stop doing something you love.</strong><strong><br></strong>Honestly I may have a little left in me.

But I don’t believe you haven’t done that kind of introspection.</strong><br>Right, well, I didn’t want to discuss it with journalists back then. Or with anyone really. Even my therapist. When I first started going to her, I’m like, “There’s some things I want to work on but let’s not fix that side of me.” And she said, “I would like to talk about if you want to talk about it.” I just said, “I don’t want to go there.”</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjhgulk4q002v3b609okchchf@published data-word-count=62><strong>Were you worried that talking about why you do stunts would make you stop doing them?</strong><strong><br></strong>Yeah. I thought if I fixed that side of me then stunts would go away. It’s not like I don’t get how crazy it all is. I do. I get it. But I guess you could also argue that shutting the discussion out is not getting it.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjhgulk4q002w3b605i4sllgy@published data-word-count=58><strong>That depends on what you want your life to be. &nbsp;</strong><strong><br></strong>Obviously this is tough to talk about.<strong> </strong>But it’s something I need to talk about.

There’s the open, fun, adventurous side of the coin.<strong> </strong>I was always a little inclined that way. But I opened that side of me way up as I came into adulthood. And then there’s the other side of it: I’m sure some of wanting to do stunts comes from an unhealthy place. You know what I mean?</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjhgulk4r002y3b606ge4q5zj@published data-word-count=133><strong>I do.

But you’ve always been reluctant to do similar thinking about you and your own work.</strong><br>Yeah, it’s a weird thing. Like, me doing stunts and hurting myself is a perverse part of my self-worth. Wow, people like me because I fall down and go boom. But what happens when I no longer fall down and go boom?<a href=#> I can stand in front of a bull</a>, but can I be myself? I hope I’m not coming across like I’m whining about some existential crisis. People have real problems out there.

Are you watching YouTube stunt videos?</strong><br>I’m so insulated. I’ll film or come to the office and then I’ll go home and be with my wife and kids. That’s it. It’s embarrassing that I don’t know more of what’s going on with YouTube stunts. I couldn’t name anybody that’s doing it.

I did Bad Grandpa and then I was working on Being Evel and then I spent years trying to develop Action Point. I was also producing things and trying to pursue more dramatic work. Yeah, I don’t know.

I felt like I had to be that wild guy. You don’t even know at the time that you’re only doing what you think people want you to do. You’re just expending energy and not thinking about why. Eventually I realized that you can’t give so much to this idea of who you’re supposed to be. I guess I’m realizing that with the stunts, too.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjhgulk4t00333b606mltz8we@published data-word-count=75><strong>Realizing what exactly?</strong><br>You know, it’s like I loved <span class="clay-annotated kiln-phrase" aria-describedby=annotation-6 tabindex=0>Hunter S.

Also I met my now-wife and I wanted to be a better person for her. Then I got into it and thought, I gotta be a better person for me, too. I’d never really thought like that before.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjhgulk4t00343b60dhbsn70r@published data-word-count=42><strong>So how’d you dial back?</strong><strong><br></strong>I had a couple of close friends, people I really respect, go, “You maybe need to dial it back a little.” I got what they were saying.

And I know that you love Jack Kerouac and that you’re working on a <span class="clay-annotated kiln-phrase" aria-describedby=annotation-7 tabindex=0>David Allen Coe</span> documentary. All these people — Evel Knievel, too — share a particular form of American male rebelliousness. Do you see the Johnny Knoxville character as being in that lineage more than the lineage of skateboard culture or Tom and Jerry cartoons?</strong><br>There is an outlaw-esque vibe that I like to those people you mentioned, but mostly what I do comes from my father.<strong> </strong>He’s my biggest influence. He’s a larger-than-life character. I think of him and his buddy Jackie Gilbert as Kerouacian figures. My dad is something else.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjhgulk4t00363b60cjkyvx9q@published data-word-count=156><strong>He ran a tire shop, right?</strong><strong><br></strong>Yeah, in the McAnally Flats in Knoxville [Tennessee]. That’s the area that Cormac McCarthy wrote about in Suttree. Some of the people he mentions in that book, like Red and Holmes, my dad grew up with. And the guys that worked at the tire shop were huge characters, too. There was Woodrow Wilson Boxcar Johnson Jr.: He was the tire groover and always getting arrested for something silly. They once suspected him of robbing a convenience store. They took him to jail and said, “Mr. Wilson, we have your fingerprints at the scene. We know you robbed it.” And he said, “You ain’t got my fingerprints — I was wearing gloves!” And there was Big George, Big Sam — someone took a box cutter to Big Sam’s face. Ass-Kickin’ Robert. Jackie Gilbert would hitchhike across Central America at the drop of a hat. Dad always had this group of guys around.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjhgulk4v00373b60avh3iwcm@published data-word-count=48><strong>His own Jackass gang.</strong><br>Yeah, and they were a captive audience and he’d fuck with them all the time — staging gunfights and stuff. He would send people fake letters from the VD clinic, saying they had to go in and get checked.

We loved each other. Some people who try to do what we did interpret it as macho or angry. They forget that there was a real sweetness to Jackass. We gave each other hell, but we cared about each other. I think people responded to that. And we came out of skate culture at a time when that was getting into the mainstream in a big way. Beyond those things, I don’t know why we took off.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjhgulk4w003f3b60a5xokzqh@published data-word-count=122><strong>I also remember people writing about Jackass in the context of whether it was art or performance art or if it was purely nihilistic — asking serious questions about the meaning of the movies.

The<a href=#> giant-hand prank</a> makes me giggle because it’s straight out of Tom and Jerry.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjhgulk50003q3b60r35sahe9@published data-word-count=114><strong>And the flip side to that question: Were there stunts that you felt maybe crossed a line morally or safety-wise?

I wasn’t fond of that idea. I knew it was a great opening to a scene but how do you end it?</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjhgulk50003r3b603nw02qcd@published data-word-count=89><strong>You didn’t see how it could pay off comedically?</strong><strong><br></strong>No, because I knew what the payoff meant. I thought that the only way that footage was usable is if it ended with Steve-O getting bit by a shark. But why would we do that? I didn’t think it was funny. I don’t want him missing a leg. But we still shot it and Steve-O kicked the shark in the nose before it bit him. Now that’s funny. Look, we didn’t know where the line was. It was constantly getting redrawn.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjhgulk51003s3b60fzrq5de2@published data-word-count=176><strong>Can you explain the process of coming up with stunts? How meticulously are you diagramming them out?</strong><strong><br></strong>Sometimes I draw diagrams with stick figures. But for Jackass we could go anywhere and do anything. We were pulling things out of thin air. I hate to go back to cartoons, but seeing them would make me think, I could do that. That’s where<a href=#> getting run over by a yak</a> while I was smoking a cigarette blindfolded came from: Tom and Jerry. So we’d just go off in our minds and get ideas. But for Action Point the process was more focused. The stunts had to take place in theme park. And they had to work with the rides we were using — rides that were available in the time [1978] when the movie takes place. So we’d think about what was the worst thing that could happen on those rides. But I wouldn’t say it was easier or harder writing stunts for Action Point than it was for Jackass because I never find it hard to write stunts.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjhgulk52003t3b60odk8p10n@published data-word-count=187><strong>But when you say &nbsp;“writing” stunts — that’s what I’m curious about. How much of a plan is there for flinging yourself off of a giant slide?</strong><strong><br></strong>Okay, I’ll walk you through that alpine-slide stunt [from Action Point]. So you have this incredible slide with many curves. I knew I wanted to achieve great speed and I wanted to fly off the track at the worst spot. That was the goal. Then you start talking about how to do it. We have a stunt coordinator, Charlie Grisham. We never had a stunt coordinator until Jackass 3D. Having one helped because he would test whatever stunt we had in mind. Like when we flew out of the pool [in Jackass 3D]<a href=#> with the Jet Ski</a>. In the old days, we would’ve gotten a Jet Ski that probably wasn’t powerful enough. Or our ramp would’ve been at the wrong angle. So we would’ve gotten there on that day and the stunt wouldn’t have worked. But Charlie knew the right Jet Ski, the right angle of the ramp — all we had to do is show up and pop the throttle.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjhgulk54003u3b603dx44dja@published data-word-count=131><strong>And he did the same prep work for the alpine-slide stunt?</strong><strong><br></strong>Yeah. He’d know the plan: I need to come off at a bad spot, fly through the air, and then go boom. But then he also knows that the slide doesn’t naturally have enough angle to give us a lot of height when I fly off, so we might have to put a little kicker ramp on it that’s hidden from the camera that’ll make me go higher up in the air. He’s getting the right cart with the right wheels and stuff like that. And he knows that we want to find a landing area where the slide is on an incline because that’ll help take away a bit of the energy of the impact when I hit the ground.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjhgulk55003v3b60d2s3lobd@published data-word-count=117><strong>And then it’s all you?</strong><strong><br></strong>Yeah, and I’m thinking, I’m gonna try to take all the impact on the shoulder — not worrying for one second about my head. And as I’m walking up the hill to do the stunt, I see that about 20 feet from the landing area is an ambulance with its engine running and the doors wide open. I’m like, “Are you fucking kidding me? Can you hide the ambulance? At least don’t have the engine on.” But thank god they did because I came off that ramp six feet in the air and traveled over 20 feet. I did land on my shoulder but my face absorbed all the energy of the impact.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjhgulk55003w3b60d2cpfvmu@published data-word-count=107><strong>Jesus.</strong><strong><br></strong>A good portion of my memory got erased for like an hour.<strong> </strong>It slowly started coming back. I knew a few people’s names. I knew that I’d just done a stunt on the alpine slide. I knew we were making a film but I didn’t know what film. I couldn’t retrieve any other information. It was a very serious concussion. Then after they checked me out and said I was all right, I go back to my hotel and I have blood in my nose. Gotta get that out. As soon as I blow my nose, my left eye pops out of its socket. That was odd.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjhgulk55003x3b603o7f3t0g@published data-word-count=42><strong>Certainly not typical.</strong><strong><br></strong>Nope. I’d broken the orbital lamina ethmoid bone. So when I blew my nose, I blew air behind my eye and it pushed my eye out of its socket.

When we started, we would go in anywhere and start doing pranks. But we learned the hard way that if you go into a store and start doing that, you need a location agreement signed by the owner. Because if they don’t sign, everything you’ve done is wasted. So we started calling the store owners ahead of time. We’d tell them what we’re doing, get them to sign the location agreement, and say they could not, under any circumstances, tell their employees what was going to happen — because if the employees knew, the surprise would be ruined. Then we’d go in and do the prank. And most of the time, the employees, knowing that the owner signed, would also sign the agreement when we were done.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjhgulk5800423b60nu1nstrt@published data-word-count=91><strong>What about for man-on-the-street pranks?</strong><strong><br></strong>When there’s no owner involved, then you have to go get the people to sign an agreement after the prank is over. There’s a real art to that. We hired people specifically for that job. The trick is to let people talk long enough so that you can figure out what they want to hear. Some people just want to yell at you. Some people just want to be calmed down. But 95 percent of the time you can get them to sign without having to pay.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjhgulk5800433b608l1dyha7@published data-word-count=71><strong>If the stunts part of your career is winding down, what kinds of projects are going to get you excited? &nbsp;</strong><strong><br></strong>Well, we’re in the very early stages of the David Allen Coe documentary, and I love doing those kinds of films.
