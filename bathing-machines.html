If 21st century society may be described as “overexposed,” it’s fair to qualify the 19th century as one of underexposure — and there’s perhaps no better example of that than the bathing machine. Bathing machines actually began appearing in the 1750s, but were borne out of more practical concerns: At that time, men and women generally bathed together, and naked."><meta name=author content="Jenniffer Sheldon"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

Ironically, as soon as swimsuits were invented it was decided that a “proper” lady shouldn’t ever be seen wearing one.</p><p>While Victorian men were free to frolic in full view up and down the seaside, their female peers were virtual prisoners of the bathing contraption. Essentially mobile dressing rooms, these bathing machines took women to and from the shore, providing them cover while they dipped their toes in the water — in full swim dress, of course.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-74509 alt="pier bathers" width=750 height=500 data-sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/pier-bathers.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-74509 class=wp-caption-text>Southport Iron Pier in the 1860s. The 3,600 foot structure is considered to be the first of Britain’s pleasure piers.

In reality, no walls or fences separated female swimmers from the gaze of the crowds on the beach itself, rendering the normative utility of the bathing machine rather hollow.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-74514 alt="three waders" width=750 height=500 data-sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/three-waders.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-74514 class=wp-caption-text>Three girls walking barefoot at the edge of the water, not knowing they were being photographed, c. 1890s. Photo: SSPL/Getty Images</p><p>The bathing machine, whose invention is historically credited to a Quaker named Benjamin Beale, consisted of little more than a box on four carriage wheels. Typically its walls were wood or canvas over a wooden frame, and advertising for products like soap and pills were often featured on the exterior. A raised box within the carriage allowed the bather to leave her clothing there, preventing it from getting wet when the machine entered the water.</p><p>Some machines were more luxurious than others. As this 1847 account has it,</p><p>“The interior is all done in snow-white enamel paint, and one-half of the floor is pierced with many holes, to allow of free drainage from wet flannels. The other half of the little room is covered with a pretty green Japanese rug. In one corner is a big-mouthed green silk bag lined with rubber. Into this the wet bathing-togs are tossed out of the way.</p><p>There are large bevel-edged mirrors let into either side of the room, and below one juts out a toilet shelf, on which is every appliance. There are pegs for towels and the bathrobe, and fixed in one corner is a little square seat that when turned up reveals a locker where clean towels, soap, perfumery, etc. are stowed. Ruffles of white muslin trimmed with lace and narrow green ribbons decorate every available space.”</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-74515 alt="Victoria Hotel" width=750 height=500 data-sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Victotia-Hotel.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-74515 class=wp-caption-text>1864 photograph of the outside of the Victoria Hotel with bathing machines on the seafront.

After what was deemed an appropriate amount of time, the bathing machine would then be brought (typically by horse — or less often with human power) to sea.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-74511 alt="pulled carriage" width=750 height=500 data-sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/pulled-carriage.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-74511 class=wp-caption-text>A horse pulls a bathing machine into the water at the beach at Margate in Kent.

When the bather neared the back of the bathing machine, the dipper would essentially push her into the water.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-74506 alt="Victorian Bathing Machines Katherines Rock" width=750 height=500 data-sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Katherines-Rock.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-74506 class=wp-caption-text>A view of the town of Tenby in Pembrokeshire, Wales taken from St. Katherine’s Rock.

For several years after, bathing machines would remain parked at numerous beaches as stationary changing houses for women and men alike – but by 1914 most of the bathing machines had disappeared.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-74520 alt="Dip Your Toe" width=750 height=500 data-sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/dip-your-toe.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-74520 class=wp-caption-text>A re-purposed bathing machine.
