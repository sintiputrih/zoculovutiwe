Talk heavy, hit hard! Wake up and fight!” Purchase the 1st official FTR shirt on ShopAEW NOW!</p><p>FTR could stand for any number of things. They teased different meanings in the past. If F*ck The Rest is really what they’re going with for their new tag team name then that could open the door for much more profanity-filled merchandise to come.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-twitter wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter"></figure><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure><span class=author-name>Felix Upton</span> <span></span><p>Felix Upton is a seasoned writer with over 30 years of experience.
