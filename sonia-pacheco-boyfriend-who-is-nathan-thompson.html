He captioned it, “The best is yet to come….<br>Spring 2023 🤍&nbsp;<a class="x1i10hfl xjbqb8w x6umtig x1b1mbwd xaqea5y xav7gou x9f619 x1ypdohk xt0psk2 xe8uvvx xdj266r x11i5rnm xat24cr x1mh8g0r xexx8yu x4uap5 x18d9i69 xkhd6sd x16tdsg8 x1hl2dhg xggy1nq x1a2a7pz _aa9_ _a6hd" tabindex=0 role=link href=#>#babygirl</a>.”</p><h3><strong>Nathan Thompson Ex-Wife</strong></h3><p>Nathan Thompson was previously married to his ex-wife Sydney Kaplan in an “epic” wedding in Beverly Hills, California. The exes were introduced at a mutual friend’s house party in Malibu. <span>“We ended up talking the whole time we first met,” Sydney said at the time. “When I was single again, I really wanted to go out with Nate.”</span></p><p>The chance to go on a big group date arose three months later. Nate wasn’t aware that Sydney was free, but a friend insisted he goes. Following their reunion, things moved swiftly, and a month later Nate and Sydney were living together. The two really momentarily broke up a year later, but their whirlwind romance was far from finished as they quickly reconciled six months later and got engaged two months later.</p><p>Hawaii was the setting of the proposal, and the staff of the Four Seasons Resort Maui at Wailea traveled to a designated area for the event.</p><p>“I hadn’t seen it yet, so I didn’t know what to expect,” says Nate. “It looked like a reception for two people who just eloped, and Sydney thought someone else was getting married. I had cameras set up and a drone to take videos and pictures. Once we got down to the spot, I proposed. We ended up eating dinner there, and then all our family showed up.”</p><p>The marriage ended two years later after Sydney filed for separation/marriage dissolution in December 2020, per <a href=#>UniCourt</a>.</p><p>Before that, Nathan was married to Cristin Thompson with whom he had his son Teague. But the married couple divorced in February 2015 when Cristin was pregnant with Teague for six months.</p><p>In the same way, Sonia also has a daughter from her relationship with Jeremy named Ava Renner. Ava turned 9 years old in March 2022.</p><h3><strong>Nathan Thompson Age</strong></h3><p>Nathan Thompson’s date of birth is 5 October 1984. Hence, his age is 38 as of 2023.</p><h3><strong>Where Is Nathan Thompson From?</strong></h3><p>Nathan Thompson was born in Anchorage, Alaska.</p><h3><strong>Nathan Thompson Parents</strong></h3><p>Robert and Cathy Thompson are the parents of Nathan Thompson. However, his parents are no longer together and his mother is currently married to her husband Jim. They tied the knot in September 2014 and Nathan wished him, “Congratulations Mom and Jim. Thanks for a great weekend. <a class="x1i10hfl xjbqb8w x6umtig x1b1mbwd xaqea5y xav7gou x9f619 x1ypdohk xt0psk2 xe8uvvx xdj266r x11i5rnm xat24cr x1mh8g0r xexx8yu x4uap5 x18d9i69 xkhd6sd x16tdsg8 x1hl2dhg xggy1nq x1a2a7pz _aa9_ _a6hd" tabindex=0 role=link href=#>#nofilter</a>&nbsp;<a class="x1i10hfl xjbqb8w x6umtig x1b1mbwd xaqea5y xav7gou x9f619 x1ypdohk xt0psk2 xe8uvvx xdj266r x11i5rnm xat24cr x1mh8g0r xexx8yu x4uap5 x18d9i69 xkhd6sd x16tdsg8 x1hl2dhg xggy1nq x1a2a7pz _aa9_ _a6hd" tabindex=0 role=link href=#>#AKneverdisappoints</a>.”</p><p>On Mother’s Day 2021, Nathan wished his mom, “Happy Mother’s Day mom.
