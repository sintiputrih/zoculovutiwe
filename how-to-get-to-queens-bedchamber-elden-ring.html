<span>Aldo Pusey</span></p><h1>How To Get To Queens Bedchamber In Elden Ring</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>“Elden Ring” players are surely familiar with the game’s grueling boss battles and cruel world map; frequently, simply getting where you need to go is challenging. The action RPG throws players into the enormous Lands Between with little to no instruction, with the exception of infrequent remarks from NPCs and hazy navigational instructions from Sites of Grace. As if taking on bosses like Maliketh, the Black Blade, or Miyazaki’s favorite fight, Starscourge Radahn, wasn’t difficult enough, it’s easy to get lost in the vast world and even land up somewhere well above your current strength level.</p><p>Overlooking the fading ruins of fortified fortresses and broken castles is the beautiful Leyndell, Royal Capital. To get to the Capital’s royal castle, players must negotiate its streets and passageways. After the Elden Ring was destroyed and several people tampered with Destined Death, this once-glorious metropolis fell. Players will inevitably have to go to the Elden Throne and pass through the Queen’s Bedchamber there, but getting there is difficult than it seems. Leyndell, which can occasionally seem like a maze, is full of dangers that keep players from exploring it at their leisure. This is how you enter the Queen’s Bedchamber in “Elden Ring.”</p><h3>Climb ramparts, stairs, trees, and a dragon to reach Queen’s Bedchamber</h3><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/climb-ramparts-stairs-trees-and-a-dragon-1654028338.jpg alt width=780 height=438 sizes="(max-width: 780px) 100vw, 780px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><br>After entering the Capital, players should make their way to the lower level of the region, being sure to keep a look out for the various knights and other enemies that are abounding. You should finally reach the first haven of the city, the Avenue Balcony Site of Grace. After walking down and forward, the next stop is a squad of knights protecting a dead dragon. Sprint up its wing and jump onto a section of the castle wall to scale the dragon carcass to greater heights.</p><p>Up ahead, a brave gargoyle and a few Oracle Envoys are guarding a Golden Seed and a large branch that serves as a route forward. After scaling the branch, players will meet Godfrey, the first Elden Lord, in a large room. After dealing with the ghost of Godfrey, as shown in a YouTube video by TheGamesEntertainer, you can keep climbing the branches hanging over the balcony to reach even upper areas of the castle. From here, you can immediately visit the Queen’s Bedchamber Site of Grace, which has the fourth-best boss encounter in “Elden Ring,” starring Morgott, the Omen King.</p><a class=m-a-box-avatar-url href=#><img width=150 height=150 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/logo-Finale.png alt itemprop=image style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a><h5><a class=m-a-box-name-url href=#>DCS</a></h5><a href=# class=m-a-box-data-toggle><span class=m-a-box-string-more-posts>+ posts</span></a><p>Our Team DCS includes 5 different writers proficient in English and research based Content Writing.
