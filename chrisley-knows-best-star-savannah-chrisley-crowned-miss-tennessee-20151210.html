"It was such a blessing to be able to compete with such amazing girls this weekend!! Any one of these girls could have won the crown! Thank you to @wkeithpittman for helping me with my dress crisis and getting me this @sherrihill gown! Thank you again Kent Parham for perfecting my walk! And thank you Gerald for helping me with my interview! Thank you to my parents and friends for helping me prepare for this weekend. But MOST IMPORTANTLY thank you God for allowing me to live such a blessed life. Can't wait to spend the next year with my sister queens and soon to be second mom @usakimig."</p><p>Savannah's multimillionaire dad, Todd, took to Instagram too to pay tribute to his daughter as she was announced winner of the pageant.</p><p>"My @savannahchrisley has given us more smiles and moments of greatness than I have space to list, I am so proud of you for who you are and the young woman you are becoming, you were born with a double crown yet the Lord chose to crown you again, make him proud and the rest will follow … With all my heart I love you," he said.</p><p>And, as seen in a photograph which Savannah shared later of her cuddling up to her mother, Julie, on the Miss Tennessee Teen stage, mom couldn't have been happier either.</p><p>"Happiness for me is seeing my mother smile," she wrote. "I love this woman more than life itself because she gave me everything: she gave me love, she gave me her soul, and she gave me her time…nothing makes me happier than knowing and seeing how proud she is of me…thank you for being on the crazy journey with me…and REMEMBER…it's not MY journey…it's OUR journey."</p><p>Chrisley Knows Best returns Tuesday, Nov. 10 at 10 p.m. ET/9 p.m. CT on USA.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGacoKKewK2x2Gaip6enqHqjsdKtZKyskad6tK3VmqWnmZhisKm%2ByKyjnrFdmL%2Bww82em2almajAbsDEp6Weq6Oasm5%2Bj2psamphZXw%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./256207-tichina-arnold-celebrates-daughter-alija-html.html><span>←</span><span>Tichina Arnold Celebrates Daughter Alijah's 17th Birthday with a Sweet Video of Her Childhood</span></a>
