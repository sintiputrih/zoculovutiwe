Panterra was born Alexis Leila Afshar on May 22, 1989, in Sonoma County, California. She is of Iranian and Irish descent.

Panterra’s video of herself twerking went viral on social media in 2014. She revealed to the No Jumper Podcast that her video “just [expletive] exploded.” The podcast’s host made a passing reference to her OnlyFans account, prompting Panterra to declassify her as a sex worker. Additionally, she revealed that she is the platform’s most subscribed user. Following the conversation’s midpoint, she discussed dating Wassabi and described their relationship as “healthy and happy.”</p><h2 data-changed=false data-paragraphid=588>More About Lexy</h2><p>Alexis Liela Afshar, better known as Lexy Panterra, is an American Twerking (dancing) artist who has become a social media sensation due to her incredible dancing and singing abilities.

Lexy’s Lex TwerkOut leggings were reportedly sold out in some stores due to her popularity. The girl also has a strong business sense.
