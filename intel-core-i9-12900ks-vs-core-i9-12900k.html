Intel has skipped these special edition CPUs for a few generations, and the Core i9-12900KS isn’t a great return to form. It’s a problematic CPU with high thermal and power demands, and in many cases, it doesn’t offer a benefit over the base model."><meta name=author content="Larita Shotwell"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

The Core i9-12900KS arrived in April 2022 for a significantly higher price of $739. Those may be the prices listed by Intel, but there’s a big difference with what you’ll actually pay.</p><p>The <span data-cloudcity=1 data-pid=SOLkh8tMnu data-type=textlink id=dtcc-SOLkh8tMnu class=dtcc-affiliate--textlink>Core i9-12900K</span> runs between $600 and $620, while the <span data-cloudcity=1 data-pid=sfAmnUtaGE data-type=textlink id=dtcc-sfAmnUtaGE class=dtcc-affiliate--textlink>Core i9-12900KS sells near $800</span>. There’s a range of prices, but you can expect to pay anywhere from $150 to $200 more for the KS model.</p><p>It’s important to remember that the Core i9-12900KS is newer, so it’s still selling for around $800. I expect it will become much cheaper over the coming months, though. At the time of writing, I found one in stock for $780 with a $30 rebate — and that’s less than two weeks after the CPU launched.</p><h2>Performance</h2><p>I ran the Core i9-12900KS and Core i9-12900K through a suite of benchmarks to see how they hold up. All of our tests were run on an open-air test bench with an RTX 3090 <a href=# data-injected=1>graphics card</a> and 32GB of DDR5-6400 memory. I selected only the most important benchmarks here, so make sure to read our full reviews (linked above) for the full results.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Starting with two CPU-focused benchmarks, you can see how little of a difference there is between the Core i9-12900KS and Core i9-12900K. In both Cinebench R23 and Geekbench 5, the single-core results are so close that they barely register on the graph. The Core i9-12900KS enjoys a slight 5% uplift in Cinebench, which you can easily make up with overclocking.</p><p>The differences in our multi-core results are even closer, but they favor the cheaper Core i9-12900K. In Cinebench, the cheaper part managed nearly a 4% lead. Still, raw CPU performance is largely the same between the two chips.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Real applications show a clearer difference. In creative apps like Adobe Premiere Pro and Photoshop, the Core i9-12900KS is quite a bit faster than its counterpart. It enjoys nearly a 5% increase in Premiere Pro, while maintaining a massive 12% lead in Photoshop. Those are impressive gains, but it’s important to remember that they don’t apply across all applications.</p><p>Gaming is a prime example of that. My testing revealed only a 2.2% difference between the Core i9-12900K and Core i9-12900KS in games at 1080p. That difference actually favors the Core i9-12900K, with it putting up higher frame rates in&nbsp;Red Dead Redemption 2 and Assassin’s Creed Valhalla,&nbsp;while barely lagging behind in&nbsp;Forza Horizon 4.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>The only gaming benchmark the Core i9-12900KS clearly won was 3D Mark Time Spy, but even then, it was only a measly 1% faster. If you’re concerned with gaming, something like <a href=#>AMD’s Ryzen 7 5800X3D</a> is your best option right now.</p><h2>Thermals and power draw</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Both the Core i9-12900K and Core i9-12900KS have high thermal and power limits. The faster KS model is just hotter and more power-hungry thanks to its 300MHz boost.</p><p>During a stress test, the Core i9-12900K peaked at 84 degrees Celsius, while the Core i9-12900KS climbed all the way to 101 degrees. I actually had the Core i9-12900KS under a 360mm <a href=#>all-in-one liquid cooler</a> — I used a 240mm for the Core i9-12900K — which illustrates how much hotter this special edition chip is.</p><p>The Core i9-12900KS is hotter, and it draws more power. Both chips have a rated wattage of 241W, but the Core i9-12900KS peaked at 274W during the stress test — and that was with Intel’s power limits enabled. The Core i9-12900K, on the other hand, drew 210W of power. Removing the limits, the Core i9-12900K climbed near 300W, largely matching the special edition with power and thermals.</p><p>The Core i9-12900KS is basically an overclocked Core i9-12900K, and that shows up with increased power draw and thermals. It also means the Core i9-12900KS has less overclocking headroom unless you elect for <a href=#>elaborate custom liquid cooling</a> or extreme LN2 overclocking.</p><h2>Save your money</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>The Core i9-12900KS isn’t worth the extra $200. Although Intel’s 12th-gen Alder Lake architecture has been a revolution for Team Blue, the Core i9-12900KS is the worst showcase of it. It offers peak performance, but those margins are thin and they come with massive thermal and power concerns.</p><p>On the other hand, the Core i9-12900K is a remarkable processor. It’s cheaper than the best AMD has to offer right now while offering much better performance. And with a <a href=#>little CPU overclocking</a>, it can even put the Core i9-12900KS back in its place.</p><h4 class="b-editors-recs-title h-editors-recs-title">Editors' Recommendations</h4><span id=publisher-md itemprop=publisher itemscope itemtype=https://schema.org/Organization><span itemprop=url itemtype=https://schema.org/Url content="https://www.digitaltrends.com"><span itemprop=logo itemscope itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject></span></span><span itemprop=image itemscope itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject></span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXGoquapKSnsq%2Bw0meaqKVfmLyuvNStoKefX567tbHLZpqoqpVitnp5kGtwaWibqHq3v4ycpqudXZ6Gbn2Rcmdpo18%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./great-british-bake-off-noel-fielding-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Great British Bake Off presenter Noel Fielding's net worth</span></a>
