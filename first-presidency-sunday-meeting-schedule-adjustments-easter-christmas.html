This latest letter is seen as giving similar directives for Easters and Christmases in coming years, not requiring First Presidency correspondence before each of the holidays, as well as allowing local leaders to make adjustments early as part of their annual planning and scheduling.</p><h2>What the letter says</h2><p><a class=link href=# data-cms-ai=0>The letter in its entirety reads</a>:</p><p>January 26, 2024</p><p>To: General Authorities; General Officers; Area Seventies; Stake, District, and Mission Presidencies; Bishoprics; and Branch Presidencies</p><p>Meeting Schedule: Easter Sunday and a Sunday near Christmas Day</p><p>Dear Brothers and Sisters:</p><p>Each year, Church services and meetings should be limited to sacrament meeting only on Easter Sunday and on a Sunday before or after Christmas Day. If Christmas is not on a Sunday, stake and district presidencies decide whether to hold this sacrament meeting before or after Christmas.</p><p>In addition, stake and district presidencies may consult with bishops and branch presidents to determine if there is a need to adjust start times for sacrament meetings in order to best accommodate the needs of members.</p><p>Please know of our love and appreciation to you for your dedicated service.</p><p>Sincerely yours,</p><p>(signed)<br><b>Russell M.

Christmas Day, Dec. 25, falls on a Wednesday.</p><p><a class=link href=# data-cms-ai=0>In a Feb. 15, 2023, letter </a>directing schedule adjustments and focus for Easter Sunday last year, the First Presidency wrote: “Members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints will celebrate Easter on Sunday, April 9, 2023, in commemoration of the Atonement and Resurrection of Jesus Christ. Sacrament meeting that day provides an opportunity to feature Christ-centered messages and sacred music. All other Sunday meetings should be canceled that day. Stake conferences will not be scheduled on Easter Sunday.</p><p>“During the Easter season we can strengthen our faith in Jesus Christ and share His gospel with others as we consider His life and mission. We may appropriately invite friends and family to join us that day to receive messages of hope, peace, the reality of immortality, and the possibility of eternal life through the Savior’s atoning sacrifice.”</p><p>And <a class=link href=# data-cms-ai=0>in an Oct. 11, 2023, letter</a>, the First Presidency announced that for Christmas Eve, Dec. 24, 2023, meetings on that day should be limited to sacrament meeting in each ward and branch.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEnJ%2BuqpOdu6bD0meaqKVfobKisMSrqmhqYGeBcH6OamZrbGBqhXN%2BmGidoqqjqXqxvsSsoJ2dnpjGbr%2FUp5uasV2isqbAyKeeZquTnbKlwcueZJqcmqrAtbnEp6usZZWWwLWx0WaaoaqZqMGurdI%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./devlin-net-worth-258008.html><span>←</span><span>Devlin Net Worth</span></a>
