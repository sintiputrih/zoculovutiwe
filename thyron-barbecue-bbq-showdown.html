The principle is simple enough: the competitors must simply grill up some delectable cuisine! But what good is competition if there aren't any obstacles to overcome? To demonstrate that they are deserving of the title of America's ultimate barbecue champion despite any curveballs thrown at them, eight of the nation's top backyard chefs compete against one another under one roof.</p><p>For a chance to win the title of Barbecue Showdown champion on Netflix, competitors travel from all across the nation. The American Barbecue Showdown was the previous name for this season; this time around, it's just called the Barbecue Showdown. Kevin Bludso and Melissa Cookston, two well-known barbecue judges, are back to crown the new pitmaster, and comedian Michelle Buteau will serve as host once more.</p><p>Eight of the top barbecue chefs are introduced to us in Barbecue Showdown season 2, and they're all competing to become the <a href=#><strong>winner</strong></a> and take home a sizable cash prize. Barbecue (BBQ) Showdown featured <strong>Thyron Big T Matthews</strong> as one of the cast members that competed and won, and since fans have expressed a greater interest in knowing more about him, let's go into more detail.</p><p>Previously, we talked about <a href=#><strong>Cindy Hayter</strong></a>.</p><h2>The Barbecue (BBQ) Showdown’s Winner, Thyron ‘Big T’ Matthews, Now Owns a Restaurant Where He Provides His Mop Sauce Recipe; He Is Not Active on Instagram (IG)!</h2><p>Although there were many skilled cooks in the recently released second season's Barbecue (BBQ) Showdown, <strong>Thyron </strong>"<strong>Big T</strong>" <strong>Mathews</strong> was the only <a href=# rel=noopener>winner</a> of the <a href=# rel=noopener>competition</a>.

He learned to barbecue while growing up on a Florida farm, and he had a ton of original recipes that he could use in the kitchen or on the grill. Even though many of these masters of the smoke had won previous competitions and might be well-liked in their hometowns, it was difficult to compete against competitors like Thyron Matthews.</p><p>Thyron Matthews signed up for the Netflix BBQ Showdown, wanting to establish himself as a culinary prodigy and quit his day job as a jail warden in Fayette County, Iowa. Despite having undercooked meat, he performed admirably on the first challenge. In the second assignment, which asked the participants to use various peppers to create mouthwateringly spicy dishes, he quickly found his rhythm and ended up killing it.</p><p>Thyron Matthews maintained his performance throughout the BBQ Showdown despite facing a considerable amount of competition. The closer we came to the big show, the better his attempts got. The sixth job required the cooks to prepare food using barbecue rigs built from abandoned appliances.</p><p>Thyron faced up against eight skilled grillers in the sizzling-hot Netflix series. While some of the competitors are brand-new to the barbecue industry, others have been perfecting their skills on the grill for years. As the prize was prepared to be awarded to the winner, he graded it. Season 2 of The American BBQ Showdown included the use of a variety of cooking methods, including reverse searing and smoking. During the Netflix competition, the judges looked for "crisp skin," "masterful searing," "mouthwatering smoke rings," and many other things.</p><p>A $50,000 cash reward for Thyron who successfully barbecues his way to the top. He was evaluated by many judges. One of the judges for season two of the Barbecue Showdown is <strong>Kevin Bludso</strong>, proprietor of Bludso's Barbecue Empire. <strong>Melissa Cookston</strong>, a world champion in barbecue, joined Kevin. At (<a href=# rel=noopener><strong>@melissacookston</strong></a>), you may find Melissa on Instagram.
