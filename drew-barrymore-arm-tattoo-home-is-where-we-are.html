I got a tattoo on our show today!" <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=noopener>Drew Barrymore</a> said on today's episode of her eponymous talk show. It was a dream of hers, she explained, not only because she loves tattoos, but also because the new addition holds special meaning to her and her daughters, Frankie and Olive. The new piece is on her forearm and she did, in fact, get it on TV, courtesy of Ink Master champion Ryan Ashley. The text reads "home is where we are" and Barrymore explained that it's something that she's been telling herself for the last five years.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Wherever life takes you, if you're lucky enough to be alongside people you love, then to me, that became the definition of home," she said. She also added that it's "the most important life lesson" she's ever learned.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">She also shared a clip of the tattoo on Instagram as well as uploading the segment <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=noopener>on YouTube</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_11-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">She was in tears as she shared the story behind the new tattoo, saying that having a family and people to love is the most fulfilling thing that she has in her life. She went on to say that through moving from place to place and working out when and how often she could see her daughters (she shares them with ex Will Kopelman) showed her that the idea of home is different for everyone and for her, it's wherever she is with her kids.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_13-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"My eyes are stinging because I'm crying so much. I want people to feel that no matter where they go in the world, if they're lucky enough to have someone to love ... that is so fulfilling," she said. "When I was in rental apartments, or not knowing where life was going, or so upset that the plans I tried to solidify for my kids had changed, it really led to the discovery of what home really means for me — and that is if we are together, wherever we are, home is where we are."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_19-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The new tattoo is just the latest homage to her daughters. She also has their names tattooed on her right wrist. The text is in her own handwriting because, as she explained, she didn't exactly plan it out.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_21-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I had been wanting to do it, and then, one day, we were on our way to an appointment and I was like, 'Can we just quickly stop at this tattoo shop?!'" she <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="noopener nofollow">told People</a> back in 2016. "I walked in and I was like, 'Who is available to do a tattoo ... quickly. Like, right now?' And this guy came up and was like, 'Yeah, I can.' And so I was like, 'I am going to write this down on a piece of paper, and then can you just transfer it onto my arm?' So, it's my handwriting."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57wp6jnpqinsG6e8OrnLBlkpa%2Fs8XMqKmeZ5Snsrh5wZqpq7GdpL%2BmecCrpGaskanBsLuMoaamnV2ewG7Dx56pnmWnmnqivsQ%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./billy-bragg-net-worth-2024.html><span>←</span><span>Billy Bragg Net Worth 2024</span></a>
