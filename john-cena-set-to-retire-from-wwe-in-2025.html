A lot of questions maybe, right? Like, why here? I want to talk about that for a second. I want to talk about Toronto. Matter of fact, I want to talk about Canada. Matter of fact, I want to talk about Canadians,” Cena continued in his speech.</p><p>Cena went on: “I’ve been doing this a while. I’ve been in WWE for over two decades and in that time I’ve seen incredible waves of prosperity like we got right now.

It is filled with opportunity,” he said.”I want to say thank you. Thank you so much for letting me play in the house that you built for so many years.
