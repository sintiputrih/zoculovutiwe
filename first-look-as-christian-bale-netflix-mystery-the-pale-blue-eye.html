Landor finds an unlikely ally in Poe, a less than accomplished cadet with a shadowed past, a penchant for drink, and two volumes of published poetry to his name. The Queen’s Gambit actor Harry Melling plays the author. Gillian Anderson and Charlotte Gainsbourg will also appear in undisclosed roles.</p><p data-characters=270 data-current-count=270 data-injectable=false>In the photo, Bale looks the polar opposite of his completely shaven portrayal of Gorr. As Landor, Bale sports a full beard and great mustache. He’s garbed in early 19th century clothes, with a greatcoat and vest, and also carries a pocket watch on a heavy chain.</p><p data-characters=256 data-current-count=526 data-injectable=true>The film reunites Bale for a third time with director Scott Cooper who also directed the actor in 2017’s Hostiles and 2013’s Out of the Furnace. Bale and Cooper will also produce alongside John Lesher and Tyler Thompson of Cross Creek Pictures.</p><p data-characters=126 data-current-count=126 data-injectable=false>The Pale Blue Eye&nbsp;will release on Dec, 23 for a limited theatrical run.
