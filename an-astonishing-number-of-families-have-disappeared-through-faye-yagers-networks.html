In situations of abuse such as molestation and other related crimes, children and parents who seek help from the legal system are sometimes not believed due to the child young age. In more than half of the states, children as young as 10, and sometimes as old as 14, are not considered competent witnesses at all, as the DOJ notes. In the remaining states, children and adolescents of any age are allowed to take the stand. Almost as much of an issue is how many minors are abducted each year by a parent or guardian, as <a href=# rel=noopener>Newsweek</a> goes on to explain.</p><p>As Yager herself put it in 1992, speaking with <a href=# rel=noopener>The New York Times</a> “If you were raped, and you’re 5 years old and your parents are getting a divorce and your father did this to you, no one’s going to believe you,” Yager said. At that time, she claimed to have helped an estimated 2,000 children and guardians vanish, based on The New York Times reporting. “They’re going to treat you like you’re black and it’s 1930,” Yager also added. According to some, though, Yager’s extra-judicial approach, characterized by The New York Times as vigilante justice, takes things too far. And some parents who’ve had children go missing in Yager’s network go to great lengths to find their children.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue8KroKadX5a7bq3SraanoaOdtq%2BzjKesppqVp3qwsoyfmKahnJ6ytHnHmq2eZZSewKK8z56Yq52UYsGpvs6unqFllpbGpnnYmp6eqqNiu6bA1qippKtf</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./who-is-carlos-rivera-dating.html><span>←</span><span>Who is Carlos Rivera Dating Now</span></a>
