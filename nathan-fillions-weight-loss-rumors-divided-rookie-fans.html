The reason for <strong>The Rookie's success</strong> is the show has many fans who are very invested in the cast and storylines.</p><p>Since The Rookie fans care so much, they quickly noticed that <strong>Nathan Fillion's body had transformed</strong>. In the past, fans have wanted to know <a href=#>how Rosie O'Donnell lost weight</a> and how <a href=#>Chris Pratt's career changed after his body transformation</a>. Regarding Fillion's weight loss, The Rookie fans seem to be divided on whether his body transformation is a good or bad thing.</p><h2 id=fans-are-divided-on-nathan-fillion-39-s-drastic-weight-loss>Fans Are Divided On Nathan Fillion's Drastic Weight Loss</h2><p>When <strong>Nathan Fillion noticeably lost a lot of weight</strong> between seasons of The Rookie, the show's fans had a big reaction. In many cases, The Rookie's viewers took to social media to express their opinion. One perfect example of that is one fan of The Rookie who <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">expressed why they didn't like Fillion's weight loss on Reddit</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/nathan-fillion-modern-family.jpg><p>In their post, the Reddit poster began by acknowledging that many fans thought <strong>Fillion's weight loss likely was good for his health</strong>.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">When and where was Nathan Fillion born</a>, according to Famous Birthdays?</p><table border=1 cellpadding=1 cellspacing=1 align summary><tbody><tr><td><p>When was Nathan Fillion born?:</p></td><td><p>March 27, 1971</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Where was Nathan Fillion born?:</p></td><td><p>Edmonton, Alberta, Canada</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>How old is Nathan Fillion as of February 2024?:</p></td><td><p>52 years old</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p>"I started watching the new season and was like WTF? He looks so different. I had to finally hop on the internets to see if anyone was seeing what I was seeing. I keep seeing comments like "good for him" and " he looks good!" as if he was totally out of shape and overweight before."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>However, the writer went on to express their opinion that <strong>Fillion actually looked healthier before</strong> he lost so much weight.</p><p>"He looked HEALTHY last season. To me, it looked like he aged a decade overnight. He looks like he lost weight in a short amount of time because he is sickly, not from diet and exercise. I am not saying that is how he lost his weight, I am saying the way his face looks it looks like that type of weight loss we see in patients who get sick, not svelte looking."</p><p>The writer continued, "They quit using the main promo photo of him for the "The Rookie" of him standing valiant and tall because he looks nothing like it anymore. He looked young and healthy in it and <strong>now he looks old as hell</strong>, hella saggy with lines. To me it seems this weight lose has made more wrinkles in face which happens when it sags due to fast weight loss."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The Reddit poster finished up by writing, "He doesn't glow on the screen like he once did and it distracts me how <strong>his cop clothes sag on him</strong> as if he is "playing" officer. Did people think he was overweight before? I don't get it. It doesn't look good on him, this is my opinion. He just looks unwell."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/nathan-fillion-at-the-premiere-of-the-suicide-squad.jpg><p>While that fan thought Fillion's weight loss wasn't flattering, they got lots of responses disagreeing. In fact, many fans of The Rookie responded to that post by arguing that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Fillion looks better following his body transformation</a>.</p><p>The top-upvoted response to that post began by arguing that <strong>Fillion's body changing the way it did was realistic</strong>.</p><p>"I couldn’t disagree more! His body size decreasing is actually incredibly realistic in-show. Think about it: he went from a fairly sedentary lifestyle to having an incredibly active, stressful job AND renovating a house. His body is burning tons of calories and he should , realistically, have trimmed down considerably."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/does-oprah-winfrey-still-own-part-of-weight-watchers-after-losing-around-117-million-of-her-net-worth-after-the-share-price-tanked_2.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="Does Oprah Winfrey Still Own Part Of Weight Watchers After Losing Around $117 Million Of Her Net Worth When The Share Price Tanked?">Does Oprah Winfrey Still Own Part Of Weight Watchers After Losing Around $117 Million Of Her Net Worth When The Share Price Tanked?</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>After Oprah Winfrey invested in Weight Watchers, the company's stock price tanked which has left fans wondering if she ran for the hills.</p><p>The top-upvoted responder then went on to argue that <strong>Fillion looks a lot healthier since he lost weight</strong>. "I haven’t looked up his personal reason for trimming down either but generally speaking (and I am not saying EVERY TIME) it’s usually a result of taking better care of himself. To me, he looks better not worse."</p><p>The second most upvoted response to the Reddit post criticizing Nathan Fillion's weight loss <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">mocked the original poster</a> . "Lol what? He's doing what's best for his health, not ours."</p><p>Most notably, the top-upvoted responder then went on to argue that <strong>Fillion's body should be respected</strong>.</p><p>"Also, this is incredibly harsh. His body size is his choice, not yours- and using such awful language to describe him (old, saggy, etc) is pretty uncalled for. Critique the show and the writing, but critiquing the physical appearance of a cast member is so inappropriate."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=what-has-nathan-fillion-said-about-his-dramatic-weight-loss>What Has Nathan Fillion Said About His Dramatic Weight Loss?</h2><p>Typically when a celebrity loses weight, they make the rounds talking about how they did it. As a result, there are a slew of websites that have published articles listing <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">stars who have lost weight and why they did it</a>.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/did-domhnall-gleeson-s-dramatic-weight-loss-for-one-of-his-least-known-movies-change-his-body-forever_.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="Did Domhnall Gleeson's Dramatic Weight Loss For One Of His Least Known Movies Change His Body Forever?">Did Domhnall Gleeson's Dramatic Weight Loss For One Of His Least Known Movies Change His Body Forever?</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>When Domhnall Gleeson was filming the movie Unbroken, he was so dedicated to his role that his eyes actually changed size.</p><p>When Nathan Fillion notably lost weight, however, he didn't do the typical round of interviews. He didn't pose for the cover of Men's Health either. Instead, <strong>Fillion mostly decided to stay silent</strong> on the matter aside from <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">giving a few weight-loss tips</a> during an interview with Build Series.</p><p><strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">What stars have lost the most weight</a>, according to Page Six?</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Melissa McCarthy</strong></li><li><strong>Ree Drummond</strong></li><li><strong>Bronson Pinchot</strong></li><li><strong>Adele</strong></li><li><strong>Jessica Simpson</strong></li><li><strong>Ricky Gervais</strong></li><li><strong>Ricky Gervais</strong></li><li><strong>Ariel Winter</strong></li><li><strong>Mama June</strong></li><li><strong>Jonah Hill</strong></li><li><strong>Kelly Osbourne</strong></li><li><strong>Khloé Kardashian</strong></li><li><strong>Nicole ‘Snooki’ Polizzi</strong></li><li><strong>Shonda Rhimes</strong></li><li><strong>Janet Jackson</strong></li><li><strong>Drew Carey</strong></li><li><strong>Missy Elliott</strong></li><li><strong>Jennifer Hudson</strong></li><li><strong>Chris Pratt</strong></li><li><strong>Roseanne</strong></li><li><strong>Rebel Wilson</strong></li></ul><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Perhaps <strong>Fillion decided not to comment on his transforming body</strong> because he didn't like the discussion on the topic. Perhaps Fillion didn't say anything about his weight loss because it isn't a topic that interests him.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/nathan-fillion-from-the-rookie.jpg><p>At the end of the day, there is no way for fans to know why Fillion hasn't spoken at length about his weight loss. The reason for that is the fact that Fillion also has <strong>remained silent on his decision</strong> not to talk at length about his weight loss.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The only way that Fillion has really engaged with the topic of his weight loss is with photographic evidence. In July 2021, Fillion posted a photo on Instagram <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">that showed off how ripped his arms had become</a> and how much slimmer he was. While the actor didn't include a caption <strong>bragging about his physique</strong>, as some stars do, he had to know how people would react to the image.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGilmqyYlrtussilo6Knnqh6uLHIoJ%2BtZZykwLR50a6kqKqjYrGqwsidnJ1loqS8rLXEZp2apqNk</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./david-feherty.html><span>←</span><span>David Feherty</span></a>
