"Southern Charm" star Craig Conover is now dating "Summer House" star Paige DeSoto. Still, their long-distance relationship is starting to take a toll. Meanwhile, Conover's fellow reality star ex, Kathryn Dennis, is cozying up to the new stud on the slopes.</p><p>According to a reporter from <a href=#>The List</a> who attended the "Southern Charmers" panel at <a href=#>BravoCon 2022,</a>&nbsp;the Charleston belle appeared "smitten" with her potential new love interest. Still, Dennis managed to remain coy. Dennis played it cool when a fan said they spotted her looking like she was getting hot and heavy at the After Dark party. They claimed that the show's newbie cast member,&nbsp;<a href=#>Jason Cameron</a>, was the lucky man in question. The "Southern Charm" star refused to spill the iced tea, but she did pour a small glass.</p><p>"[Jason] was very nice and told me he was going to slide into my DMs," she told the audience. Some (like Dennis' ex, for example) might recommend that Cameron spend more time sliding down the ski slopes than into Dennis' DMs, but Conover's got his own issues. Meanwhile, fellow "Winter House" cast member Austen Kroll also noticed the sparks flying between Dennis and Cameron and wondered if they would end up hooking up.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmamhla4J1fY6bqZqun5i8r3mRaWlrZZuWwam%2B2KdknZ2eo7a0ec2apJ6rXam1pnnWoqWtnaJitbDB0p5krKyRp3q4tM5mp6unnZ7AprCMraZmq5yesaZ5yKerqGWYmr9usMysZg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./jake-gyllenhaal-heath-ledger-never-joked-about-brokeback-mountain.html><span>←</span><span>Jake Gyllenhaal: Heath Ledger Never Joked About 'Brokeback Mountain'</span></a>
