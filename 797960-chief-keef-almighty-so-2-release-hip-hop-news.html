It was recently announced on social media that <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Chief Keef</a>'s long-awaited project Almighty So 2 is dropping this Friday (May 10), which has fans feeling skeptical. Outlets backed up this new claim with what seems to be an Apple Music pre-save tracklist featuring Ballout, <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>G Herbo</a>, Lil Gnar, Tierra Whack, <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Sexyy Red</a>, and Quavo. The <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">DIRTY NACHOS</a> rapper already dropped that mixtape earlier this year, but there's even more material on the way.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Or is there? A lot of hardcore Chief Keef fans and rap listeners alike pointed out that Almighty So 2 has been marred with <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">delay after delay</a>, so much so that many won't believe it until they see it. Somebody hold our liquor, because he really turned into a different version of <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Kanye West</a>, <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Playboi Carti</a>, and other notorious non-droppers in the hip-hop game. We don't know for sure what caused these pushbacks, but regardless, this Friday represents a big chance for everyone to rejoice and finally get this albatross off our necks. Or for massive disappointment... Who knows?</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-chief-keef-s-alleged-almighty-so-2-tracklist-amp-release-date>Chief Keef's Alleged Almighty So 2 Tracklist & Release Date</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Elsewhere, Chief Keef is looking to return to a Chicago stage for the first time in a decade to perform at Lyrical Lemonade's <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">Summer Smash this year</a>. We're sure that with a whole lot of new material (assuming that Almighty So 2 actually comes out), fans will have a lot of fresh cuts and classics to enjoy if nothing happens with the performance. Tickets are still available on their website if you want to attend. Otherwise, we're sure the Internet will keep us updated with some FOMO clips.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Chief Keef is also firmly on the Sexyy Red train, as the two seem to have developed <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">a strong artistic bond</a> as of late. With some collaborations under their belt, public appearances, and on-stream phone calls, it seems like a great dynamic duo for some grimy bangers. They'll apparently collaborate once more if Almighty So 2 drops this week, which is pretty exciting. But history shows us that all we can do is wait until we actually see it for ourselves.</p><p>About The Author</p><p>Gabriel Bras Nevares is a music and pop culture news writer for HotNewHipHop. He started in 2022 as a weekend writer and, since joining the team full-time, has developed a strong knowledge in hip-hop news and releases. Whether it’s regular coverage or occasional interviews and album reviews, he continues to search for the most relevant news for his audience and find the best new releases in the genre. What excites him the most is finding pop culture stories of interest, as well as a deeper passion for the art form of hip-hop and its contemporary output. Specifically, Gabriel enjoys the fringes of rap music: the experimental, boundary-pushing, and raw alternatives to the mainstream sound. As a proud native of San Juan, Puerto Rico, he also stays up-to-date with the archipelago’s local scene and its biggest musical exponents in reggaetón, salsa, indie, and beyond. Before working at HotNewHipHop, Gabriel produced multiple short documentaries, artist interviews, venue spotlights, and audio podcasts on a variety of genres and musical figures. Hardcore punk and Go-go music defined much of his coverage during his time at the George Washington University in D.C. His favorite hip-hop artists working today are Tyler, The Creator, Boldy James, JPEGMAFIA, and Earl Sweatshirt.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvTp5ywoJmltbC8jZympmdnboR6go9mmqGhlZt6rLHEn2SapJ2etKnA2GaqqGViYr%2BmuMSaqp5lmJ69brTOqWSnnaeo</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./who-is-alex-wassabi-dating.html><span>←</span><span>Who Is Alex Wassabi Dating?
