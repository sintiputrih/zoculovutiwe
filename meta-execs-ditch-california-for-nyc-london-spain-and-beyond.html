Instagram chief Adam Mosseri, Meta chief marketing officer Alex Schultz and global affairs president Nick Clegg have all either moved already or plan to move to England this year.</p><p>Clegg — the former leader of the Liberal Democratic Party and UK deputy prime minister — reports directly to Zuckerberg and leads all of Meta’s dealings with governments around the world.&nbsp;</p><p>He wants to be closer to his parents and sees London as a better location to travel to continental Europe and Asia, <a href=#>the Financial Times reported</a>. Meta is <a href=#>facing tough antitrust challenges</a> from regulators in both the US and Europe.</p><p>Mosseri, meanwhile, will help recruit Instagram staffers while he lives temporarily in the UK, where tech talent is as much as three times cheaper than in San Francisco, according to Financial Times.&nbsp;</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">Meta’s global affairs president Nick Clegg is returning to London. <span class=credit>NurPhoto via Getty Images</span></figure><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">Instagram chief Adam Mosseri is also moving to London. <span class=credit>Anadolu Agency via Getty Images</span></figure><p>As Meta shares have plunged more than 50% so far this year amid slowing growth and competition from TikTok, Zuckerberg has cracked the whip and urged managers to <a href=#>oust low-performing employees</a>. But the Meta CEO still has a more liberal <a href=#>attitude toward remote work</a> than most other Big Tech honchos.</p><p>Meta allows most employees to choose between fully remote or hybrid schedules — and Zuckerberg himself <a href=#>spends much of his time at his sprawling Hawaiian estate</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>It’s not just Hawaii and the UK that are drawing Meta’s top brass away from the company’s Menlo Park, Calif., headquarters.&nbsp;</p><p>Javier Olivan, who recently <a href=#>replaced Sheryl Sandberg as Meta’s chief operating officer</a>, is reportedly splitting his time between California and his native Spain.&nbsp;</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large is-resized">Meta product chief Naomi Gleit is living in New York City. <span class=credit>Getty Images for Teen Vogue</span></figure><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">A half-dozen Meta execs have fled the west coast so far.</figure><p>Product head Naomi Gleit is living in New York City, where Meta recently cut back on plans for expansions of its Hudson Yards and Astor Place offices, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Bloomberg reported</a> in July.&nbsp;</p><p>And chief information security officer Guy Rosen has relocated to his native Israel.&nbsp;</p><p>Meta did not respond to a request for comment on the moves.</p><p>As Meta’s leaders fan out across the world, other Big Tech companies have forced employees back into the office.&nbsp;</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large is-resized">Sheryl Sandberg’s replacement as chief operating officer, Javier Olivan (left), is reportedly splitting his time between California and Spain. <span class=credit>Bloomberg via Getty Images</span></figure><p>Apple currently requires virtually all employees to spend two days per week in the office, with plans to ratchet the requirement up to three. <a href=#>Google is also requiring three days per week for many employees</a> with more exceptions than Apple.</p><p>Amazon allows managers for individual corporate teams to decide how frequently their employees should come into the office.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimqaW8tMCNnKamZ2Jlf3N7j3FmaWtforK1rYyer56bo2KxqsDCoWScmZyes7C%2BzaKYZp6fp3qvxcJmo6imlKS7br%2FPmqCnZZGjsW6uxLKmp5xf</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./julie-ertz-pregnant-2023-zach-ertz-wife-weight.html><span>←</span><span>Is Julie Ertz Pregnant In 2023?
