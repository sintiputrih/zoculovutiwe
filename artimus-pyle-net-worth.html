All of his efforts have helped put his net worth to where it is today.</p><p>How rich is Artimus Pyle? As of late-2016, sources estimate a net worth that is at $3 million, mostly earned through a successful career in music. Thanks to his run with Lynyrd Skynyrd, he was inducted into the Rock ‘n’ Roll Hall of Fame in 2006. He has consistently toured around the world, and all of his achievements have ensured the position of wealth.</p><h3>Artimus Pyle Net Worth $3 million</h3><p>In 1967, Artimus joined the US Marine Corps, and would stay there for four years, becoming a sergeant in aviation. In 1974, he would join Lynyrd Skynyrd and three years later was involved in the 1977 plane crash that killed Steve Gaines, Cassie Gaines, and <a href=#>Ronnie Van Zant</a>, surviving the crash while suffering broken ribs, but was able to call for help. They were eventually rescued by the Gillsburg Volunteer Fire Department.</p><p>In 1982, Pyle formed the Artimus Pyle Band or APB which included Steve Lockhart and John Boerstler. They would release three albums during their run, including “APB”, “Nightcaller”, and “Live from Planet Earth”. He also took part in the Skynyrd Tribute tour, and would join the reformed band for recording “Lynyrd Skynyrd 1991” before leaving once again. According to an interview, he left the band during that time because he no longer wanted to be a part of the drugs and alcohol scene. He would then tour with the band Those Guys in the 90s, often playing venues in Florida. His net worth was steady.</p><p>In 1997, Artimus appeared in “The Howard Stern Show” to discuss the band and the events of the plane crash. His next project would be in 2004, when he recorded four studio tracks with Rambler; he also toured with the band Deep South. He’s played solo and with various acts, sometimes including former members of Lynyrd Skynyrd. He also re-created the&nbsp;Artimus Pyle band, which released “Artimus Venomous” in 2007. Three years later, he performed at a benefit concert at New York’s Roseland Ballroom, playing the song “Simple Man” alongside Gov’t Mule. In 2012, he was interviewed on “The Nick & Artie Show” and recalled events of the plane crash. One of his latest projects was being a guest performer on the Eli Cook album “Primitive Son”.</p><p>For his personal life, there is no public record of Artimus being married or having children, however, it is known that Pyle was arrested in 1993 for lewd assault and attempted capital sexual battery on two female children. He pleaded no contest and was registered as a sexual offender, although he denies the allegations, so that the children would not go on trial. He was arrested in 2007, for not registering as a sexual offender in St. Johns County, a case for which he was acquitted two years later.</p>﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿<table readability=11.103448275862><tr><td>Full Name</td><td>Artimus Pyle</td></tr><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>$3 Million</td></tr><tr><td>Date Of Birth</td><td>July 15, 1948</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Place Of Birth</td><td>Louisville, Kentucky, USA</td></tr><tr><td>Profession</td><td>Musician</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>American</td></tr><tr><td>Children</td><td>Chris Pyle</td></tr><tr readability=0.3265306122449><td>Facebook</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>https://www.facebook.com/ArtimusPyleBand/</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.20512820512821><td>IMDB</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0701497/</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.25><td>Allmusic</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>http://www.allmusic.com/artist/artimus-pyle-mn0000603254</a></td></tr><tr readability=14><td>Albums</td><td>Street Survivors, Second Helping, Southern by the Grace of God, Lynyrd Skynyrd, One More from the Road, Nuthin' Fancy, Skynyrd's Innyrds, Lynyrd Skynyrd 1991, Gimme Back My Bullets, Legend, Gold & Platinum</td></tr><tr><td>Music Groups</td><td>Lynyrd Skynyrd</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Movies</td><td>Freebird...
