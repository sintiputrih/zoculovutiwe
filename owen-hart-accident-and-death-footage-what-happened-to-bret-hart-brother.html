The advice on the cassette is to “never destroy, view or duplicate.”</p><p>Up to the launch of the WWE Network in February 2014, the rest of the event was accessible online in the form of bootleg VHS tapes taken during the event.</p><p>While the PPV is accessible via the service, it was modified to exclude the fall’s aftermath and Jim Ross’s news of Hart’s death.</p><p>To read this article, click here.
