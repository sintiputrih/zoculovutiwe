However, as things got even more tense between Frankel and Hoppy, the Skinnygirl founder&nbsp;decided to enter into a joint custody agreement with Hoppy, according to <a href=#>E! News</a>. This may have been where things went south for Frankel, according to attorney&nbsp;Martha Cohen Stine, partner at <a href=#>Cohen Stine Kapoor LLP</a>.&nbsp;Nicki Swift caught up with Stine&nbsp;to discuss this in depth.</p><p>"Looking back over the legal proceedings that spanned an eight-year period, in my opinion, one decision that Bethenny made that hurt her and that she later came to regret, was her decision not to finish the first custody trial that started in 2014. Instead of completing the trial — a lengthy, stressful, and expensive process — and hoping the judge would see things her way and award her sole physical custody and sole decision making, she called off the proceedings, and entered into a joint custody agreement with Jason," Stine told&nbsp;Nicki Swift.</p><p>However, things were too volatile between the two exes, and Stine feels that a joint custody agreement just was "not going to work." Stine told Nicki Swift that joint custody "really only works [when] the parties are amicable, get along well, and are able to co-parent cooperatively." That clearly had not been the case here.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmbHBkaX50e9OhnGannpp6tbTIp55mrJiWwW601KurZpqVqbWmus2yZJ%2BqkaO4priMrZ%2BeZZ2kwLV5yKdkoZ2iYrGqws6rmp5n</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./sonika-vaid.html><span>←</span><span>Sonika Vaid - Bio, Age, Net Worth, Height, Single, Facts</span></a>
