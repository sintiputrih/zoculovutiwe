He never hit better than .296 before breaking out in Southeastern Conference play as a senior, going 39-for-97 (.402) to lead the league in 26 conference games. At 5-foot-10, 185 pounds, he doesn't have a plus tool but has tremendous savvy and has been considered one of the SEC's top baserunners the last three seasons. He's a fine defender in right field with a strong arm as well. Yastrzemski has a quick, line-drive stroke and can pepper the gaps but will have to play some center field or be a fourth outfielder as a pro, because he lacks corner power.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7o63SnpmapJyWuqa%2ByJyYZ5ufonyxuMCynKurX2qBeoOMpqCknV2urrTA0bOcpqubnnw%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./kim-higelin-parents-father-ken-higelin-and-mother-details.html><span>←</span><span>Kim Higelin Parents: Father Kn Higelin And Mother Details</span></a>
