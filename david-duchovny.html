Despite appearing in several films, Duchovny failed to match his X-Files success until he began starring in the 2006 TV series Californication. (He later won a Golden Globe for his role on the Showtime series.)</p><p>Duchovny’s personal life has caused him trouble over the years. He married actress <a href=#><strong>Tea</strong> <strong>Leoni</strong></a> in 1997, and the couple had two children together. In 2008, Duchovny shocked fans when he checked into an undisclosed rehab center for a sex addiction. Despite the incident, the couple stayed together until June 2011, when they jointly announced their split.</p><span>More ▾</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOinKxnlJbDqrCMnaycoJ%2Bru7p7</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./christian-kirk-marriage.html><span>←</span><span>Christian Kirk Marriage, Wife, Wiki, Age, Height, Parents, Nationality, Net Worth</span></a>
