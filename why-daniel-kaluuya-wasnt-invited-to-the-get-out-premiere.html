News broke last week that the actor was not invited to the movie's big debut, leaving many fans to wonder...why?</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=#>15 Movies Like 'Get Out' To Watch On Netflix</a></span></p><h2 id=daniel-kaluuya-left-out-of-premiere>Daniel Kaluuya Left Out Of Premiere</h2><p>Jordan Peele's Get Out was easily one of the most talked-about films of 2017! The movie starred Daniel Kaluuya and Allison Williams, who played one another's love interests, or so viewers thought. Despite the success of the film, it appears as if things with Kaluuya didn't start off on the best foot.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When the Get Out&nbsp;world&nbsp;premiere took place at Sundance, <strong>Daniel Kaluuya wasn't in attendance!</strong> Why? You might ask. Well, it appears as if&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">he wasn't invited!</a> The star told the eyebrow-raising story during an interview on none other than The Graham Norton Show.</p><p>"They didn't invite me," the actor said. While the premiere date was set for January 2017, Daniel took time off from filming MCU's Black Panther in order to appear on the esteemed red carpet, however, he never made it there!</p><p><strong>"And then I just didn't get an invite. I wasn't invited,"</strong> he continued. "So, I was just in my bed. Someone texted me, 'It's done really well." The star managed to laugh it off, claiming that "that's the industry," he said, and it really is the name of the game!</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=#>An Inside Look At How An Eerie Truth Inspired The Film: Get Out</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Graham Norton was quick to chime in, saying that "somebody f***** up!" and boy was he ever right! While Norton pressed Daniel as to whether or not he complained about his lack of invitation, despite being the star of the film, Daniel brushed it off, saying <strong>he didn't want to stir the pot.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>"You don't want to be in a place that you don't feel wanted, you feel me?" he said. Considering it was the breakout film for both Daniel as an actor, and Jordan Peel as a writer-director, fans were and still are very confused as to how the film lead can be left out of the high-profile event.</p><p>Not only was the film a smash hit, but Jordan Peel took home the 2018 Academy Award for Best Screenplay for Get Out, proving just how great a project it was. Despite Daniel Kaluuya not having been invited, it appears as if Universal has yet to provide a proper explanation why <strong>leaving fans to assume Daniel was simply<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> "too new" to the industry.</a></strong></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>Next:&nbsp;<a href=#>Netflix Points Out Hilarious Detail Linking 'Get Out' And 'Inglourious Basterds'</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuobFdma6vtcSlZKSZnKrCuq2MsJispqRitq%2FCyK2cnWWkpHq1tMRmnp6sXaTCtXnPq5ymoZWnsnA%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./jon-tenney-height.html><span>←</span><span>Jon Tenney Height</span></a>
