No matter who folks were cheering for, they were sure to leave with a great story to tell.</p><p>How tight was this? Murray won 196 points, Kokkinakis 192. And they combined for 171 winners to only 107 unforced errors.</p><span class=ad__heading data-test-ui=ad__heading data-ad-env=both>Advertisement</span><a class=ad__link data-test-ui=ad__link href=# data-ad-env=both>Advertise with NZME.</a><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.nzherald.co.nz/resizer/xRwVZewp8hXWu6vAZpZ6edM39nE=/16x11/smart/filters:quality(70)/cloudfront-ap-southeast-2.images.arcpublishing.com/nzme/IP6A3ZS6RFCVNLDECWDNSZXB7M.jpg"><p>It was the second consecutive five-setter this week for three-time major champion Murray, a 35-year-old from Britain with an artificial hip who eliminated No. 13 seed Matteo Berrettini on Tuesday.</p><p>Kokkinakis is a 26-year-old from Australia who is ranked 159th and has never been past the third round at a Grand Slam tournament.</p><p>Somehow, this was not the latest finish in Australian Open history. A 2008 match at the tournament between Lleyton Hewitt and Marcos Baghdatis concluded at 4:34am., the record for any Slam.</p><p>Kokkinakis could have closed out the proceedings far earlier, having taken the opening two sets and been up a break in the third. But serving at 2-0, 40-all, he was cited by the chair umpire for taking too much time before a serve and let it get to him.</p><span class=ad__heading data-test-ui=ad__heading data-ad-env=both>Advertisement</span><a class=ad__link data-test-ui=ad__link href=# data-ad-env=both>Advertise with NZME.</a><p lang=en dir=ltr>Here we go again.

His mother, Judy, repeatedly rose to her feet to clap and yell; his coach, Ivan Lendl, did not, sticking in his seat.</p><p>When Murray delivered a second-serve ace at 2:59am., more than 4 1/2 hours into the proceedings, he owned the fourth set and forced a fifth.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>"It's a 𝐣𝐨𝐤𝐞... It's 𝐝𝐢𝐬𝐫𝐞𝐬𝐩𝐞𝐜𝐭𝐟𝐮𝐥!" 😡</p><p>Andy Murray is furious for not being allowed a bathroom break at the end of the fourth set during his late-night encounter against Thanasi Kokkinakis... <a href=#>#AusOpen</a> | <a href=#>@andy_murray</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/Q56CjltfFA</a></p>— Eurosport (@eurosport) <a href=#>January 19, 2023</a><p>That last set was, appropriately, even as can be for 10 games. There were zero breaks of serve until Murray finally converted his eighth chance of that set with a forehand winner to lead 6-5. He strutted to the sideline, shaking his neon-colored racket.</p><p>All that was left to do was serve it out, and Murray managed to do just that, wrapping up the longest victory of his career with a backhand winner. After meeting Kokkinakis at the net for an embrace, Murray screamed.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r8bHnqmapJRjsLB6zbNmrKifp8FwwMSnpaKrXZa7pcWMpqyrqpGuerG%2Bzp2snJ2jYrKxtcJmmqillZeupLeMraZmnJWbsqLAjK2fmqaRqLZut86koqKmkaC2tHnIp2SapJxiu6qzx62cq2dlbJB4naOSj4R%2BcoSRjqKtg21te4Fpp3OepGg%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./sherry-schmidt-accident-what-happened-to-the-mma-fighter.html><span>←</span><span>Sherry Schmidt accident: What happened to the MMA Fighter?</span></a>
