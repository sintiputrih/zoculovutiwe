I think if you really wanna know, you need to watch Wrestle Kingdom on NJPWWorld.com, and you will get the answer.”</p><p>Banks hasn’t appeared on WWE programming since she and Naomi walked out of the May 16 episode of WWE RAW. WWE then suspended the duo indefinitely and stripped them of the WWE Women’s Tag Team Championship. Since then, the two women have appeared at multiple red carpet premieres, and they also walked at New York Fashion Week, among other highlights.</p><p>WrestleZone will have coverage of NJPW Wrestle Kingdom 17 on January 4.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uL7ErKulnaqku6Z6wqikaKaVrMBwfZJsbmxrZGK%2FsK%2FKsmSrp52av7B5xZqlrGWnnrmtecearZ5lpKR6uK3TnJ9mppqlxG7D0Z6qraSVYriqusadpqZlYWx6tbuMoJytZZGjeqK60rCcq2Wfo3q0rdKhmGaakaO4tHnNo6ewZaKqurC%2B0g%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./karlee-steel.html><span>←</span><span>Karlee Steel- Age, Height, Boyfriend, Net Worth, Ethnicity</span></a>
