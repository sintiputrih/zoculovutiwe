Then, the Nevada took part in the June 1944 invasion of Normandy and in Operation Dragoon in southern France that same year.</p><p>Indeed, World War II made thorough use of the battleship, taking it to the skirmishes across the Pacific, including to the invasions of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Iwo Jima</a> and Okinawa in 1945, before being seriously damaged by a kamikaze pilot on March 27 and artillery on April 5 of that year.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-279318 alt="USS Nevada Firing On DDay" width=900 height=712 data-sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/uss-nevada-firing-on-dday.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-279318 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Wikimedia Commons</span><span class=caption-body>The Nevada fires during the landings on Utah Beach during the Allied invasions as a part of D-Day.</span></p><p>When the war finally ended, the Navy used the seasoned vessel as a target ship for the infamous atomic bomb tests in the Bikini Atoll on the Marshall Islands in July 1946. The Nevada was not only damaged but was left too radioactive to be put back into use.</p><p>The Nevada was officially decommissioned in August 1946 and purposefully sunk by U.S. torpedos in 1948. It wouldn’t be seen for 72 years — when a team of resourceful experts relocated it.</p><p>Ocean Infinity’s Pacific Constructor has been engaged at sea in numerous commercial tasks in the region even before the COVID-19 pandemic put everything on hold. She had surveyed over 100 square miles to find the sunken ship.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-279268 alt="40mm Gun Turret On The USS Nevada" width=900 height=507 data-sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/40mm-gun-turret-on-the-uss-nevada.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-279268 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Ocean Infinity/SEARCH</span><span class=caption-body>The Nevada‘s 40mm gun has remained in position for 72 years and sits mounted next to a partly fallen Mark 51 “gun director” which crew members used to direct gunfire.</span></p><p>“Nevada is an iconic ship that speaks to American resilience and stubbornness,” said Dr. James Delgado, SEARCH’s senior vice president and lead archaeologist on the project. “Rising from its watery grave after being sunk at Pearl Harbor, it survived torpedoes, bombs, shells, and two atomic blasts.”</p><p>Delgado added that rediscovering the ship “reminds us not only of past events but of those who took up the challenge of defending the United States in two global wars. This is why we do ocean exploration —&nbsp;to seek out those powerful connections to the past.”</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-279270 alt="USS Nevada Mast" width=900 height=506 data-sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/uss-nevada-mast.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-279270 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Ocean Infinity/SEARCH</span><span class=caption-body>The mast of the Nevada once stood over 100 feet.</span></p><p>For those of us at home, gazing at the geared steam turbines and triple gun turrets collecting marine growth, this discovery is a treat. It transports us back to a time in history where entirely different threats loomed — and were eventually overcome.</p><p>After exploring the wreck of the iconic Nevada, explore the horrors of the <a href=#>Pacific Theater in World War II</a>.
