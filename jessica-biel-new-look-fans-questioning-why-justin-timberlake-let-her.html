The Illusionist actress took to Instagram to share with her 14.1 million followers that she would be cutting her long hair. In the short clip, she holds her long hair in two many bunches and tugs it down, and the next frame is the reveal video of her sporting a short bob.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/instar53220027-1.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="Jessica Biel Almost Quit Hollywood Before Fans Supported Her Latest Project ">Jessica Biel Almost Quit Hollywood Before Fans Supported Her Latest Project</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>If "The Sinner" hadn't taken off, Biel said she was seriously thinking about retiring from her production company.</p><p>She captioned the post with a short message: "Brought back the f*** a** Bob." <strong>But instead of praising her new look, fans were hesitant to embrace it, and there were even some cries about how Biel's husband, Justin Timberlake, could let her do this.</strong></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=fans-react-to-jessica-biel-39-s-short-hair>Fans React To Jessica Biel's Short Hair</h2><p>There are a few positive <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">comments on the video</a>, but it's the negative ones that are the most obvious. "Cute but noooooo, long hair flatters you more," one fan wrote. Another agreed, writing "Makes you look older." Other comments on the post include, "Nah girl, you a long hair girl," and "Instant regret." But it is the messages about Justin Timberlake that are bizarre (why would he have any say in his wife's decision to cut her hair?). "JT how could you let her do this," a comment reads, followed by a crying face emoji.</p><span class=txt>Close</span> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"Someone is having a love breakdown ... I wonder what Justin did this time …" another Instagram user wrote, suggesting that there could be <a href=#>trouble in Biel's marriage</a>. Others agree with this assessment, as a comment claims, "Radical hair change for women usually means a break up is on its way."</p><p>Some fans have criticized the negativity and defended Biel. "People can be so unkind!!! And we wonder why kids are mean," one comment reads. "You look beautiful!" Another fan also took note of the mean comments. "Wth?!! These comments are horrid. Your criticism is not as crucial as you think it may be," they wrote. "It's time to do a little inward evaluation and healing. Jessica, doing you, looks good on you."</p><p>"What are these hateful ass comments," an Instagram user wrote. "Let people thrive with what THEY like and support their styles. It’s not that hard to just NOT be hateful.
