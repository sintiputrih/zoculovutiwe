Even at its age, Battlefield 4 remained a challenging game in its own right, as very few mass market MP shooters push the envelope on graphics quality right now.

However with the GTX 1080 Ti, the card is fast enough that it is still going to hit smooth 60fps framerates even with MSAA. With a 33% performance lead over the GTX 1080 and a 74% performance lead over the GTX 980 Ti, you can in fact finally have it all with Battlefield 4, even at 4K.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7orrAp5utnZOde6S7zGiqoaenZH5yfZdpZq2glWK7t7XDophmn5WbvLOvxGaerbBdZn15fIytoGaqlau2psOOcQ%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./alyssa-navarro.html><span>←</span><span>Alyssa Navarro</span></a>
