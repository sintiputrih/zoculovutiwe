The <a href=# rel>idea of retirement</a> has come up in conversation for the father of one, but he doesn't seem to be ready to walk away from his career quite yet. In fact, the past few years have seen him dropping more regularly than ever, with albums like Certified Lover Boy, Honestly, Nevermind, and Her Loss all making waves in their own unique ways.</p><p>Following the surprise arrival of the latter in late 2022, Drizzy announced that he and <a href=# class=text-word rel>21 Savage</a> will be <a href=# rel>heading out on tour</a> together. After months of preparation, they're finally due to take off at the end of June, but that doesn't mean the Canadian isn't still spending time in the studio preparing to drop more heat. Via his Instagram Story on Friday (June 3), he hinted at reuniting with a past collaborator, though we now know the image was actually taken with a doppelganger, and not the real R&B star.</p><p><strong>Read More:</strong> <strong><a href=# rel>10 Essential Sampha Tracks</a></strong></p><span><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-drake-confirms-another-sampha-collab>Drake Confirms Another <a href=# class=text-word>Sampha</a> Collab</h2></span><p>@champagnepapi/Instagram Story</p><p>"@sampha and me cooking up something crazy," Drake wrote above a photo of him and a Sampha lookalike enjoying dinner. While the latter kept things casual in a black tee, the "In My Feelings" artist showed his love for pop culture by donning a Betty Boop sweatshirt. "Weird you lost your London accent, but whatever," Champagne Papi added. "People evolve I guess." It remains unclear if Drake and the real Sampha actually have plans to reunite in the studio, or if he was simply cracking jokes.</p><p>Two of their biggest hits, "Too Much" and "The Motion" arrived in 2013, and four years later they came together again on "4422" from the More Life mixtape. The singer has been relatively quiet in recent years, with his last single being 2022's "Backwards" alongside Lil Silva. Before that, he showed out on "Walking Flames" and "SOLDIERS" in 2020 with Actress and Headie One/Fred again.... respectively. Which of Drake and Sampha's previous collaborations is your favourite? Let us know in the comments, and check back later for more hip-hop/pop culture news updates.</p><p><strong>Read More: <a href=# rel>Drake Considers Massaging IG Model Corinna Kopf's Feet During Stake Live Stream</a></strong></p><p>[<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Via</a>]</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvTp5ywoJmltbC8jZympmdmbYJ0g49mm6uZm5p6tK3MqZ%2BaZZOkua2twWaaqKaWnr%2BuscNmoKerpJa0s63MZqqtp6Ku</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./70-all-time-best-christmas-cookie-recipes.html><span>←</span><span>80 Best Christmas Cookie Recipes Modern Honey</span></a>
