Drummer Jerry Speiser and bassist John Rees thought the hiatus took too long, so they opted to leave the group. Without those two, the group still made the album "Two Hearts,"&nbsp;which did not fare as well as the previous two albums, reaching a high of No. 50 on the charts — though it did reach gold status in the United States. The group disbanded after that, with&nbsp;Colin Hay going on to record solo albums, per <a href=#>Oldies</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Over the years, the group would reunite from time to time, mostly in the form of Hay and saxophonist Greg Ham. They had a massively successful tour in Brazil in the mid-1990s, per <a href=#>AllMusic.</a> Then Ham died in 2012 and the real soul of Men At Work was gone. Despite the years and the losses, Men At Work remain a unique reminder of a singular time in the history of pop music.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qL7Up56eZpOkunCDk3Bsam9fqbWmedGemKVlopqutLvNZqSepl2WwW7DzquiZpqipLimedSpZK2glWKzqr7SrWStoZ2afA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./keiynan-lonsdale.html><span>←</span><span>Keiynan Lonsdale</span></a>
