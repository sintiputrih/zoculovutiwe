With producers choosing to bring everyone back, the feuds carried over into the new season. There have been reports of Kathy Hilton leaving a girl’s trip and Lisa Rinna and Erika Jayne possibly falling out. As the season 12 premiere inches closer, Kyle is teasing the spectacle that went down once the cameras started rolling.</p><p>Kyle, Lisa, Erika, Garcelle Beauvais, Dorit Kemsley, Sutton Stracke, and Crystal Kung Minkoff are making comebacks with Kyle’s eldest sister Kathy Hilton returning in a friend role. Newcomers&nbsp;Diana Jenkins and <a href=#>Sheree Zampino were added</a> to the mix, with Sheree being real-life best friends with Garcelle. Erika was in the hot seat last season due to her alleged involvement in Tom Girardi’s embezzlement case. Her defensive attitude led to a number of showdowns with the ladies. While Lisa stood by Erika’s side, hints have shown that the tides might’ve turned while filming season 12. Garcelle also ended in a rough patch with Lisa and Dorit and opened up about feeling like a black sheep. But with her friend joining the show, Gsrelle will have some backup.</p><p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag>SCREENRANT VIDEO OF THE DAY</strong></p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=#>RHOBH: Delilah Hamlin Spotted On Date With Jack Nicholson’s Son Ray</a></span></p><p>Kyle recently dished on what it was like filming the new season and why <a href=#>she agrees with Andy Cohen </a>about the season 12 premiere being&nbsp;“the best first episode” he’s ever seen. “This year, there was so much going on with everybody right out of the gate, that it was just automatically drama from day one,” Kyle told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">People</a>. Between Erika’s ongoing legal issues, Dorit being a victim in a home invasion, and Lisa’s family losing her beloved mother Lois, there was a lot for producers to work with. While Erika is in the middle of serious legal and financial matters, Kyle says fans will get to see a different side of her in season 12. “You’re going to see a much lighter side of her, a much more open <a href=#>side of her,”</a><a href=#> Kyle</a> shared.</p><figure class=item-img></figure><p>With all of the “crazy” life events the ladies were facing during filming, Kyle says&nbsp;“crazy lives make good TV, I guess.” Kyle is known to avoid the drama, and her sister Kathy doesn’t entertain it at all. There have been reports of things going left during the cast trip to Aspen and Kathy attempted to “get out.” While filming the trip, Kathy left a seemingly frantic comment on Rick Hilton’s Instagram post begging her husband to&nbsp;“Please call me I need to get out of here now!!!!!” A local ran into the ladies at a coffee shop and tweeted that&nbsp;“some s–t clearly went down.” The pre-existing tension <a href=#>between the RHOBH cast most</a> likely led to a number of showdowns among the ladies.</p><p>Garcelle and Sutton have been the most vocal about Erika’s charges and the “Pretty Mess” singer made sure they felt her wrath. Lisa’s loyalty to Erika rubbed Garcelle the wrong way and while they made up at the season 11 reunion, Garcelle likely spoke her mind when filming season 12. With Diana and Sheree being added to the mix, the newbies will have to pick a side and hold their own among the alpha women. From the sounds of it, <strong>The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills</strong> is coming back with a bang.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next:&nbsp;<a href=#>RHOBH: Erika Jayne Reportedly Falling Behind On Rent</a></span></p><p>Source:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">People</a></p><p><strong><span class=next-btn-text-title>90 Day Fiancé: Ximena Debuts Shocking Hair Transformation After Mike Split</span></strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue8inq56qpp6yuL%2BOpLClnV2ntqS0wKubrGWjlsa0edGhppugXaiyor%2FOp2Rqal2drqV5w6uYppldm7%2BwuYydmLJln6OycA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./jessie-j-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Jessie J Net Worth : Lifestyle &amp;amp; Career</span></a>
