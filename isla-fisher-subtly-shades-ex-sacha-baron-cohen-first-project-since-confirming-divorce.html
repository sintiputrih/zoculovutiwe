In 2023 we jointly filed to end our marriage,” it said.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“We have always prioritized our privacy and have been quietly working through this change,” they continued. “We forever share in our devotion and love for our children.
