Pink meat can be obtained through fishing. Its drop rates are really low, so you will have to fish multiple times in order to get at least one."><meta name=author content="Aldo Pusey"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

Its drop rates are really low, so you will have to fish multiple times in order to get at least one.</p><p>While you can get Pink Meat from the Level 1 fishing spot, but the more advanced ones appear to have higher drop rates for this extremely rare item.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Where to get Pink Meat in Potion Permit – Full Guide</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/commonsensegamer.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/large-pink-meat-in-potion-permit.jpg><p>As mentioned before, this item can only be obtained through fishing. Make sure to read my previous guide on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">how to unlock the fishing rod</a> (and especially the part on upgrading it).</p><p>Basically, you will have to go fishing 60 times in order to upgrade your fishing rod. Once you do, you will be able to fish in the more advanced fishing spots, where the chances of Pink Meat dropping increase.</p><p>I personally managed to get Pink Meat with the basic fishing rod, from the Level 1 fishing spot – but I only got one in some 20 or so fishing trips. So there’s definitely a bit of a grind involved here!</p><p><strong>Related</strong>: Having trouble finding things in the game? Read my guide on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">where to find Jasmine flowers</a>.</p><p>You need Pink Meat to complete some quests in the game, so it’s best to prepare in advance.</p><p>Spend a lot of time fishing in order to increase your chances – I can only assume that the Level 2 and 3 fishing locations have a higher drop rate for Pink Meat.</p><p>I’ve seen some players reporting better chances lately and getting more Pink Meat than White Meat in the game, so there might be other things that influence what type of meat you get, like the moment of the day when you go fishing or something else that I’m not fully aware of.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/commonsensegamer.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/pink-meat-and-chips-700x293.jpg><p>But even going at it blindly, like I did and fishing like crazy is enough for you to get the required amount. In the end, you will have heaps of it:</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/commonsensegamer.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/potion-permit-pink-meat.jpg><p>So sit back, relax, make sure that you’ve got plenty of bait available and start fishing – there’s no other way to do it!</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>While some players (including myself) found it to be one of the rarest and most annoying resources to get in Potion Permit, at least you know now how to get it.</p><p>If you manage to see some sort of a pattern (for example, higher drop rates at the better fishing locations), let us all know by commenting below.</p><p>Also, leave a comment if you manage to tie higher drop rates to anything else happening in the game and not just pure luck.</p><p>And while you wait for the fish to bite, why not check out my previous article where I listed <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">all the Potions in the game</a>? It will sure come in handy!</p><a href=# class=url title="Calin Ciabai" rel=nofollow><img width=250 height=250 decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/commonsensegamer.com/wp-content/uploads/gravatar/calin-authorbox.jpg.png alt="Calin Ciabai" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a> Common Sense Gamer’s founder and current Editor in Chief.
