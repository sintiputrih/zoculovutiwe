Biopics don’t always succeed. Time and time again, we’ve witnessed this recurring phenomenon in Hollywood: a promising biographical film that initially garners attention as potential Oscar bait, only to fade into relative obscurity months after its debut on the big screen. Take Blonde and Bohemian Rhapsody as lackluster instances of semi-failed biopics.

I brought home a bunch of shishito peppers from the farmers market, but the base of this recipe is so versatile – feel free to sub in a star vegetable of your choice.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Thembi Nyandeni Biography, Age, Career &amp;amp; Net Worth</h2><time>Aug 30, 2024</time>
