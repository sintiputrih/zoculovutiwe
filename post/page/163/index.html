In a room full of executives, coaches, and contractors, there is always one Bachelorette contestant who stands out among the crowd of eligible bachelors.

In the new season, premiering July 11, bachelorettes Rachel Recchia and Gabby Windey meet James Clarke, a 25-year-old man whose occupation is one of the franchise’s funniest — and perhaps most delicious ones – yet. As excited as fans may be for Rachel and Gabby to find love, there’s no getting around that any season of The Bachelorette is only as good as its cast, and James is sure to get people talking.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Josephine Park Kone And Kirstine K.

Octavia Spencer, podcasting for justice in Truth Be Told. Truth Be Told is a logline show, meaning that when described in brief — on paper, the Internet, or in quick conversation — it sounds excellent.
It stars Octavia Spencer, Aaron Paul, Lizzy Caplan, Elizabeth Perkins, Ron Cephas-Jones, and Mekhi Phifer, among others. It’s a murder mystery with a true-crime podcast element; it’s not based on a podcast, but on a novel about a true crime podcaster, played in the series by Spencer, who’s attempting to prove the innocence of a convicted killer.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Who Is Alexander Dugin Daughter Darya Dugin And What Happened To Her?</h2><time>Feb 2, 2024</time>

It's safe to say that Kylie Jenner is an expert in the makeup department — especially when it comes to lips. The beauty guru founder has been open about having lip filler, and she practically invented concept of lip kits when she launched her eponymous makeup brand in 2015. Now, the mogul is resurrecting a lip trend that was popular in the '90s, when she was probably a little too young to be repping the fad: dark-lined lips.</article><nav class=main-nav><a class=prev href=../../../post/page/162/>← Prev Page</a>
