The singer said at the time in a statement: "Both of us have longed to have children, but the reality that we now have two sons is almost unbelievable."</p><p id=eOKO2UbsR7n data-wc=44>Elton and David have chosen to keep the name of their surrogate secret and hidden from the public to protect her identity. According to the Mail Online, the famous had a brilliant relationship with her but wanted to keep her protected from the public.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/89754065734d-gettyimages-949937866.jpg><h2>What have Elton John and David Furnish said about their family?</h2><p id=eKgiR2Eoj6- data-wc=34>Although the boys are kept mostly away from the spotlight, Elton and David clearly adore being parents to Zachary and Elijah and they've expressed their pride in the youngsters many times in the past.</p><p id=eTi-wPvYGkk data-wc=48>Last year, the boys were welcomed on stage by their dad David and godmother Lady Gaga at the Oscars Viewing Party. David told HELLO! at the time how their sons were keen to get involved in the planning of the event since their dad Elton was on tour.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/ac1aecee9a5a-elton-john-david-furnish-sons-scuba-diving-z.jpg><p id=egB8gMpJcQY data-wc=60>"They heard us talking - we had planned for Elton to be off the road in February but then they moved the Oscars to March, and fans had been holding on to tickets for 700+ days and we knew we couldn't keep moving shows," David said. "So the boys said, 'we will help you.' I am really proud of them."</p><p id=ekZPZakCOB1 data-wc=51>Elton, meanwhile, opened up about how he's eager for his sons to learn the value of money on their own without taking their huge fortune for granted. The superstar clearly wants to keep his sons grounded, telling the Guardian in 2015: "I'm their dad, I'm famous, they live an extraordinary life.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/bb30ff5132df-elton-john-sons-zachary-elijah-z.jpg><p id=erC7_X_QIJX data-wc=74>"David and I talk about it all the time, we're fully aware of the pitfalls that might happen. They are spoilt in the way they live and how they're living, but they're not spoilt when it comes to the rules they have to live by. They get Â£3 pocket money, but Â£1 is for charity, Â£1 is for saving and Â£1 is for spending, they get three coins and put them in separate jars.</p><a href=# style=text-decoration:none rel="noopener noreferrer">View post on Instagram</a>&nbsp;<p id=eFOLrRV9rnc data-wc=30>"And they have to work for it â help in the kitchen, help in the garden.

"That was the greatest decision I've made â well â we've made, in the last six years, is to have those boys," the proud dad explained to the Today show. "They're our primary concern. They're the things that come first and foremost."</p><p id=eIy8JI1B15gq data-wc=61>He added: "[Zachary] is very proud of his daddy, but he's more interested in 'Hotline Bling' by Drake or 'Uptown Funk,'. They sing 'Rocket Man.' They sing 'Benny and the Jets.' ... They know who I am. They know what I do, but they're more interested, to be honest with you, in their toys. And I'm fine with that. That's good."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbHLpaammZeWx6q6xGeaqKVfnbKiuNOhmKeckpqutsDYaKSorJiav26tzZ1km5mSrnx1hZRyam1nlaHBsLqMo6ahpl2Wu6V5w5qtopxdm8Kzusisn6xlo6S7tHnZmpqhmaKueqK6w2acpaGalrW0edKuqaunl5awunnSraaroZWoerOx1Z6YpZ2UZA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./dean-winters.html><span>â</span><span>Dean Winters: Age, Family, Siblings, Girlfriend, Medical Condition, Net worth</span></a>
