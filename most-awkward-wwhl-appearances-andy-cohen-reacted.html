"He was very problematic for the gays at one point when I&nbsp;was coming up," the host continued.</p><p>Burgess, who was visibly put off by this, replied, "Oh,&nbsp;I see, he wasn't problematic for Tituss, and we had a wonderful time. ... Any troubles he may have had with gay people I guess are gone because he loved me," Burgess replied before saying something to someone in the audience.&nbsp;When Cohen asked Burgess about it, the actor replied, "Keep going, girl. Do your show."</p><p>Following the episode, Burgess called Cohen out in a very long and very shady Instagram comment. "He should remember his talk show isn't an episode of the real housewives of Atlanta!" Burgess wrote.&nbsp;"Sunday was a display of ratchet behavior by a well connected man having blatant disregard for one of his guests." Burgess went on to appear on Wendy Williams' show and, of course, the "WWHL" drama came up (via <a href=#>People</a>). "I will not tolerate the dismantling of anyone's legacy," the actor stated, "especially not my own."&nbsp;In a 2020 interview with <a href=#>Hollywood Unlocked</a>, Burgess said he was no longer at odds with Cohen but still wasn't cool with the remark.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmampmbYZ5f46mpqysXZbErMPAq5tmr6eduW6tz6mcmqqRo7Cmv4yapZ2xXZi8qbHNZqmemZOpsqV7</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./the-alps-hotel-nakuru-nakuru-kenya.html><span>←</span><span>The Alps Hotel Nakuru, Nakuru, Kenya</span></a>
