I’ve ran into people before and honestly nothing compares to what happened today,” he tweeted, adding a crying face emoji .</p><p>Carter clarified that everyone is doing OK after the accident though. “Everything is fine,” he wrote. “Thank you for all the support and love. Means a lot. Accidents happen. I’m just happy both of us were ok.”</p><p>He also responded to a concerned fan, writing, “All of my airbags went off and I’m cut up all over, at least everyone survived and we’re good.”</p><p>Carter’s rep confirmed to <i>Us Weekly</i> in a statement that the pop star is resting after the incident. “Aaron was in a traffic accident this morning near his home and fortunately no one was hurt. Aaron is fine and at home resting,” the statement read. “He will be performing in Memphis on Saturday and in New York on Tuesday and looks forward to seeing all his fans.”</p><p>The singer has been through a lot this summer. He was arrested in Georgia in July on charges of driving under the influence and marijuana possession. Afterward, his older brother<a href=#> <b>Nick Carter </b></a><b></b>publicly reached out to offer help. <a href=#>Aaron responded by slamming his brother</a>. “If my own blood truly cared about my well-being, why wouldn’t he call me directly and have a conversation instead of making this about him through a very public forum?” he tweeted at the time. “That’s not cool at all to use me for his PR and kick me while I am down.”&nbsp;</p><span class=caption></span><p>A few weeks later, the “Aaron’s Party” crooner <a href=#>split from his girlfriend <b>Madison Parker</b> </a>just a few hours after <a href=#>Aaron came out as bisexual in an emotional post</a>. A source told <i>Us Weekly</i> at the time that the musician is better off now that he’s out of the relationship.&nbsp;</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“Madison was not a good influence on Aaron,” the insider told<i> Us</i>, adding that “Madison really was not supportive of Aaron’s sexuality and didn’t understand it.”</p><p>For the latest celebrity entertainment, news and lifestyle videos, <a href=#>subscribe to</a> Us Weekly’s YouTube Page.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGaamaKku26vwKurnqpdnru3u8uvnJ1lmaN6tLHVnqmeZZOWv26twpygnZ2eqXq4gY9qam9pXw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./ufc-news-ufc-on-espn-11-predictions-josh-emmett-vs-shane-burgos.html><span>←</span><span>UFC on ESPN 11 Predictions: Josh Emmett vs Shane Burgos</span></a>
