Hopefully, I’ve been a good example in terms of how I show respect to my wife.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Barack’s second reason was a bit more light-hearted. “They have Secret Service,” he joked. “There’s only so much these guys can do!”</p><p>Scroll to see more photos of Sasha’s big night out!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8sbXCrayrnaNkwKK%2Fx5pkqJqRoq5us86eqmasn2K9s7vMZquao5WoeqetzKKjsmWgnrC1wdGeqmavmam1brnInJ%2BepJyaeq6ty6KYaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./messyness-photos-mtv-show.html><span>←</span><span>Messyness Photos Of The MTV Show</span></a>
