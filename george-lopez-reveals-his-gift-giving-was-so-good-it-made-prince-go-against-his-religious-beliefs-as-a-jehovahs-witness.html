Lopez shared that the “<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Purple Rain</a>” singer was initially reluctant to accept the gift because he was a Jehovah’s Witness.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=17 data-current-count=17 data-injectable=false>Lopez said,&nbsp;</p><p>“When I had my show, I gave Prince, the great Prince a white box that had a hat in it but he didn’t know what was in it.

I said ‘at least look at it.’ He says ‘I can’t the gifts I’m a Jehovah’s Witness.’… And then he lifts the box up and almost like a spring loaded purple feather comes out.”</p><p data-characters=185 data-current-count=185 data-injectable=false>The&nbsp;Lopez vs Lopez&nbsp;star added that when Prince was made aware of the gift, he put it on and started walking around with it like the fictional character George Jefferson. Lopez shared,</p><p>“So he takes it out and it’s this purple beautiful brim and he hit the brim and he put it on like George Jefferson and he walked in front of me… And I said ‘too bad you can’t keep it.” He said, ‘oh no I’m keeping this one.'”</p><p data-characters=364 data-current-count=364 data-injectable=false>Later in the interview, Lopez provided details about his friendship with Prince, including the “Kiss” vocalist offering to be his bible study teacher to limit the amount of profanity the&nbsp;George Lopez&nbsp;star uses.
