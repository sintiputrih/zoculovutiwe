Your child should briefly thank the admissions committee for reconsidering their application and reiterate their commitment to the school.</li><li class=TrT0Xe>Mention new accomplishments not included in the original application.</li><li class=TrT0Xe>Your child’s interest in the college.</li></ul><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=should-i-write-a-letter-after-being-waitlisted></span>Should I write a letter after being waitlisted?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3>Many schools <b>will</b> ask students via survey or email whether they want to <b>be</b> an active member of the <b>waitlist</b>. While <b>it’s</b> imperative to respond in the school’s requested format, you <b>can</b> often send an additional <b>letter</b>. Strategy is key, though. Your high school counselor may <b>be</b> able to help you formulate one.<h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=how-long-should-a-waitlist-letter-be></span>How long should a waitlist letter be?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3>Your step-by-step guide to writing a <b>waitlist</b> update. Update <b>letters should</b> be short – no more than two pages. Keep the <b>letter</b> focused on what you have accomplished since applying.<h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=is-being-waitlisted-bad></span>Is being waitlisted bad?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><b>Being waitlisted</b> is unlike <b>being</b> deferred; the college has finished reviewing your file and made a decision to put you on a waiting list for admission. In some cases, your chances of eventually <b>getting</b> in are very good; at other colleges, <b>waitlisted</b> applicants are almost never admitted.<h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-percentage-of-waitlisted-students-get-accepted></span>What percentage of waitlisted students get accepted?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3>According to a 2019 survey from the National Association of College Admissions Counseling (NACAC), 43 <b>percent</b> of four-year colleges reported using a <b>waitlist</b> in 2018. Of all the <b>students</b> who <b>accepted</b> a position on the <b>waitlist</b> at these colleges, 20 <b>percent</b> were <b>accepted</b>.<h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=do-colleges-waitlist-overqualified-students></span>Do colleges waitlist overqualified students?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><b>Overqualified students</b> (quantified primarily by GPA and SAT/ACT) are routinely being waitlisted or denied at “no problem” <b>colleges</b> because the admissions committee feels doubtful these <b>students</b> are likely to enroll if accepted. Admission to the most selective <b>colleges</b> is as unpredictable as ever.<h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=is-deferred-or-waitlisted-better></span>Is deferred or waitlisted better?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3>Being <b>deferred</b> from a college is not the same as being placed on the <b>waitlist</b>. Most college deferrals occur when a student has applied early action (EA) or early decision (ED) to a college. Even though being <b>waitlisted</b> sounds <b>better</b> than being rejected, odds of getting off a <b>waitlist</b> are not in a student’s favor.<h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=why-did-i-get-waitlisted></span>Why did I get waitlisted?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3>Most of the time, it means you have the academic credentials to be admitted, but for one reason or another, the admissions office wasn’t ready to accept you. If you’ve been <b>waitlisted</b>, don’t panic. A good plan of action is to make sure you have a solid list of safety schools to apply to just in case.<h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=should-i-accept-waitlist-offer></span>Should I accept waitlist offer?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3>Wait-listed applicants can typically either <b>accept</b> or reject a <b>waitlist offer</b>, usually via postcard or online. “Students <b>should</b> only <b>accept</b> a spot on the <b>waitlist</b> if they would rather attend that school than any other school they have been admitted to,” Rim says.<h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=is-deferred-bad></span>Is Deferred bad?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3>While it is disappointing not to have an acceptance in hand, a <b>deferral</b> does not mean that you’re out of the admissions race! In fact, a <b>deferral</b> should be considered a second chance to highlight your strengths and what you have accomplished during your senior year.<h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=is-being-deferred-a-good-sign></span>Is being deferred a good sign?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3>Condolences if you have been denied. If you have been <b>deferred</b>, that’s actually <b>good</b> news because it means that an admissions office has decided to postpone making a decision about your application until the regular admission cycle. Many top students get <b>deferred</b>; often it’s difficult to know exactly why.<h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=does-deferred-mean-rejected></span>Does deferred mean rejected?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3>What <b>does</b> it <b>mean</b> to be <b>deferred</b>? A <b>deferral</b> letter is neither a <b>rejection</b> nor acceptance. Take a look at the glass half full and think of it as a second chance to impress the admissions committee. A student is <b>deferred</b> when there isn’t enough information or context to put them through a full acceptance.<h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=does-harvard-accept-deferral-letters></span>Does Harvard accept deferral letters?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3>When you apply in the early action pool, <b>Harvard</b> will deny, <b>defer</b>, or <b>accept</b> your application. Getting “<b>deferred</b>” just means that <b>Harvard</b> still thinks you’re pretty neat-o and wants to look at your application again during the regular decision pool.<h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=does-mit-defer-everyone></span>Does MIT defer everyone?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3>Each spring <b>MIT</b> gets another ~10,000 applications for regular decision to add to the <b>deferred</b> ones from early action. In a typical year, a few hundred of those <b>deferred</b> get offered admission in the regular pool. So while not a high percentage, there are still a lot of chances. Not at all.<h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=can-i-defer-my-mit-admission></span>Can I defer my MIT admission?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3>If you’re <b>admitted</b> to <b>MIT</b>, you may <b>defer</b> enrollment for one or two years. After confirming your intent to enroll in <b>MIT’s</b> first-year class, you will be asked to submit a formal request for <b>deferment</b> to the Dean of <b>Admissions</b>. Such requests are usually granted (indeed, often encouraged!).<h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=why-did-mit-defer-so-many-applicants></span>Why did MIT defer so many applicants?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3>“Because our <b>applicant</b> pool <b>is so</b> strong, we <b>defer many applicants</b> to Regular Action <b>for</b> further review. While <b>many of</b> them <b>are</b> not ultimately admitted, we <b>do</b> admit some portion <b>of</b> our <b>deferred applicants</b>.<h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=why-do-students-get-deferred></span>Why do students get deferred?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3>If you’ve been <b>deferred</b>, usually it’s because the college wants to see how your application compares with applications submitted by <b>students</b> applying regular decision. After considering your application in the regular decision round, you can be accepted, rejected or waitlisted.<h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=how-do-i-get-accepted-after-being-deferred></span>How do I get accepted after being deferred?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><b>Below are 6 things that you can do to improve your chances of <b>being admitted</b> in the regular admissions round.</b><li class=TrT0Xe>Write a letter.</li><li class=TrT0Xe>Solicit another letter of recommendation.</li><li class=TrT0Xe>Take more standardized tests.</li><li class=TrT0Xe>Add to Your Resume.</li><li class=TrT0Xe>Demonstrate Interest.</li><li class=TrT0Xe><b>Get</b> straight A’s.</li><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DAxJyfaKCfrHq1u46hprBlpKR6uL7IrZxmmV2srqrAy6KqrWWcmsG1sdFo</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./bryce-hall-peeing-on-fans.html><span>←</span><span>Bryce Hall Criticized for Peeing on His Fans at Playlist Live</span></a>
