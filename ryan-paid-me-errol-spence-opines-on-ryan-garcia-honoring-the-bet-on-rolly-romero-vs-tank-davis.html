Ryan Garcia had to pay up a whopping $20,000 in cash to Spence Jr. after he lost a bet!</p><p>The bet in question was made ringside between Errol Spence and Ryan Garcia. Garcia was rooting for Rolando Romero during the clash with Gervonta Davis. Davis won the fight in the 6th round, handing out a loss to both his in-ring opponent Romero and Ryan Garcia via his pocket! A lot of bets are made and never paid! But it seems like Ryan Garcia is a man of his word! Errol Spence tweeted to let the whole world know that Ryan paid him his bet money!</p><p>Here is the tweet by Errol Spence Jr.:</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Ryan paid me ü§ù<a href=# rel=noopener>@RyanGarcia</a></p><p>‚Äî Errol Spence (@ErrolSpenceJr) <a href=# rel=noopener>June 1, 2022</a></p><p>The massive $20,000 payout was delivered as promised by Garcia. To be noted, Garcia fights at lightweight while Eroll is the welterweight champion of the world! Errol Spence got the distinction of earning all possible belts after he defeated Yodernis Ugas in April of 2022. <a href=#>He was subsequently called out by undefeated WBO champion, Terence Crawford.</a></p><p>Ryan Garcia is also undefeated in his professional career! His division is soon about to be shaken to the core when lightweight champions George Kambosos Jr. and Devin Haney go head to head on June 5th of 2022 in Melbourne, Australia!</p><p>Seeing the heavy financial losses he suffered due to a bet, It is safe to say that Ryan Garcia will be much more careful before betting so callously and losing a big chunk from his pocket!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tLzOq6usspmku2%2BvzqZmq7GRo3qxrcidZKadXZq%2Fs7vLZqqpnZ6Ysm67z6KlnqtdpLtuvtiapWafkaewqq2Moaanp6Keu6h506GcZpqVqXqwuoyrpqWkqWK%2FsLnEq6ZmrqNiwaK6ymabmq6ZqHw%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./johnny-depps-wild-style-evolution-his-craziest-fashion-moments.html><span>‚Üê</span><span>Johnny Depps Wild Style Evolution: His Craziest Fashion Moments</span></a>
