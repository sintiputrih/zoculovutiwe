The webhead has an incredible collection of bad guys who are far more popular than The Spot. Green Goblin, Doctor Octopus, Venom, Electro, Vulture, heck even Big Wheel is more well-known than The Spot is. However, while The Spot may look like Marvel's answer to Polka Dot Man, <strong>his role in Across the Spider-Verse makes him one of the most dangerous villains Spider-Man has ever faced</strong>. Plus, his history in the comics proves he's no slouch, either.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=the-comic-history-of-the-spot>The Comic History of The Spot</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/johnathon_ohnn_-28earth-616-29_and_peter_parker_-28earth-616-29_from_amazing_spider-man_vol_1_589_002.jpeg><p>Before becoming the supervillain known as The Spot, the comic book character was originally known as Johnathon Ohnn (notice how Johnathon has an extra "o" because...you know...spots). Ohnn was once a brilliant scientist who studied at MIT, even being the roommate of a much more popular Spider-Man villain, Quentin Beck, who would go on to become the deceptive Mysterio. Ohnn's brilliant mind was also one susceptible to corporate greed and avarice, as he had no qualms about accepting a job offer from criminal Kingpin, Wilson Fisk.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Fisk became interested in the science behind teleportation, particularly in how another New York-based superhero, The Cloak, was able to teleport virtually anywhere at will. Ohnn's research eventually opens a pitch-black portal, which the ambitious researcher made the ill-advised decision to step into the mysterious gateway. <strong>When Ohnn eventually finds his way out of the portal, the once-human scientist is now something else entirely.</strong> Many of his anatomic features such as his face have vanished, his skin has been turned a bright white, and is covered head to toe in black spots, each of which functions as portals to various realities including his own.</p><h2 id=the-spot-is-often-treated-as-a-joke-in-marvel-comics>The Spot is Often Treated as a Joke in Marvel Comics</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/johnathon_ohnn_-28earth-616-29_from_amazing_spider-man_vol_5_66_001.jpeg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse, The Spot is frequently referred to as a "villain of the week," implying that he's a low-level goon rather than a significant threat to the heroes of Marvel. That's pretty much how the Spot is frequently treated in the original comics, and his first meeting with Spider-Man makes that quite evident. After getting his powers from the portal he made and embracing his potential as a supervillain, The Spot confronts Spidey for the first time. The meeting doesn't go as planned as <strong>Spider-Man can't help but laugh at the villain's goofy name and his even goofier appearance.</strong></p><p>Though perhaps Spidey underestimated his new foe, as The Spot's unpredictable abilities prove to be a challenge for Spider-Man. The Spot beats his foe in their first encounter, but that victory was short-lived. All his future tanglings with The Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man ended in The Spot getting defeated. Since then, despite being a certified super-genius, Johnathon Ohnn spent most of his supervillain career as a villain-for-hire, helping the more reputable Spider-Man villains with various heists and dastardly plans. That's not to say that all of Spot's misadventures were comedic, as he took a brief stint as a ruthless vigilante after his son, Wyatt Ohnn, was caught in a drive-by shooting.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=the-spot-is-surprisingly-powerful>The Spot is Surprisingly Powerful</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/the-spot-part-dos.jpg><p>Despite being openly mocked by both heroes and villains, <strong>The Spot's time seeking vengeance for his son showed just how powerful and deadly the character really is</strong>. The villain's titular spots may look a bit silly, but they are incredibly useful tools for the bad guy. He can peel them off at morph and edit them to his liking. Not only can they teleport him across long distances, but the spots can even transport The Spot to other dimensions, such as the Negative Zone.</p><p>The Spot's interdimensional capabilities also make him one of the few villains who can circumvent Spider-Man's Spider-Sense, one of the hero's most reliable defense mechanisms. That said, the spots do have a drawback, as they are finite, and The Spot only has a limited number of them. It's never explicitly clear how The Spot is able to develop more spots in the comics, though presumably, they just regenerate over time.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>There's also another surprising byproduct of Johnathon Ohnn's transformation - <strong>he's virtually invincible</strong>. The character has been killed at least half a dozen times in the comics, yet he's always able to come back. He's had his neck snapped, been decapitated, and dismembered in all sorts of gruesome ways, but he's able to pop back in to cause trouble every single time.</p><h2 id=the-spot-is-determined-to-be-miles-morales-39-arch-nemesis-in-39-spider-man-across-the-spider-verse>The Spot is Determined to be Miles Morales' Arch-Nemesis in 'Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/across-the-spider-verse-the-spot0.jpg><p>When Miles Morales (<a href=#><strong>Shameik Moore</strong></a>) first encounters The Spot, the bumbling, overconfident goon seems to be just another bad guy. <a href=#>He's currently trying to steal an ATM from a local convenience store</a>, and he's not exactly doing a great job. However, once Miles begins fighting the villain, The Spot leads Spider-Man on a teleporting chase across the entire city. Once the two's chase concludes, The Spot reveals a surprising connection he has with New York's One and Only Spider-Man.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It turns out <a href=#>this universe's version of Johnathon Ohnn was a scientist at Alchemex</a>, the science division owned by Wilson Fisk (<strong>Liev Schreiber</strong>) and overseen by Olivia Octavius (<strong>Kathryn Hahn</strong>) from the first film. Their tests for the company's dangerous super-collider began with bringing in smaller beings, with one of them being a radioactive spider from Earth 42 - the same one that bit Miles and gave him powers. Ohnn was caught in the explosion of the super-collider after Spider-Man and his friends destroyed it in <a href=#><strong>Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse</strong></a>.</p><p>Now disfigured, <strong>The Spot has sworn vengeance on Spider-Man for what he did</strong>. He finds the location of another super-collider in Earth-50101, the home of Spider-Man India (<strong>Karan Soni</strong>). Once he uses it, The Spot becomes a being of pure dark energy, capable of destroying entire dimensions at the snap of his fingers. The Spot has threatened to destroy everything and everyone Miles Morales has ever loved. A terrifying threat that will presumably reach an epic conclusion once the third chapter of the trilogy, <strong>Spider-Man: Beyond the Spider-Verse</strong>, finally releases.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse is available to stream on Netflix in the U.S.</p><p><span class=affiliate-single><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Watch on Netflix</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmibn6G5qrDEq2Wcp51kwLG1w56pZqWRo3qir9GoqqxlpJ2ybr%2FPopueql2rsrO%2FxGaroZ1dqL2wwI4%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./jordan-hicks-wife.html><span>←</span><span>Jordan Hicks Wife: Is Jordan Hicks Married?</span></a>
