The words appeared on flashcards in my mind when I woke up, naked, hungover and alone in Pavel’s bed.’</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>She went on to say that despite spending the night in one of the most extravagant hotel suites to ever have been built, she felt ‘oh so cheap.’&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Despite this, Saskia, who ‘felt guilty’ when she had to cater for the Russian in front of his wife, revealed that her huge debt and fear of losing her job meant that the one night of sex quickly turned into an affair.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘So my routine continued, with its five o’clock calls and sex in the company of chandeliers, fine wines and the works of Monet, Picasso, Matisse,’ she added.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span class="mol-style-bold femail-ccox mol-style-medium">A SAUDI PRINCE WHO BEDDED HIS MISTRESS IN THE AIR</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Three years passed and Saskia then began working for Saudi prince Hossein*, where secret affairs continued.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Saskia was told: ‘Just a few white rose petals on the pillow for the princess. Always red petals for the other woman though – bloody truckloads of the things.’&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Recalling the time she caught the Saudi prince and his mistress Sabeen* having sex, she said: ‘There were lumps and bumps moving beneath the cashmere blanket, clothes discarded on the floor, and what looked to be a thong the colour of raw squid coiled on the table next to the canapés.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘Fortunately they were in missionary position and facing the rear of the plane, so they didn’t see me.’</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Saskia was told that working for Hussein was on a ‘safe jet,’ which she came to learn meant the&nbsp;plane’s owner didn’t expect his flight attendants to ‘put out.’&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span class="mol-style-bold femail-ccox mol-style-medium">BEING FITTED FOR A DESIGNER WARDROBE AT HARRODS&nbsp;</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Saskia, who was at one point in considerable debt but now lives debt free, was blown away when she was handed a designer wardrobe for her first job on board a private jet.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>She said: ‘This was a whole new wardrobe – a very expensive one, too, complete with shoes, boots, luggage and accessories. The line-up went something like this: sexy black secretary-style suit comprising a pencil skirt and jacket, nipped and tucked and ending mid-hip; tailored black trousers; a classic fitted black dress; virgin wool charcoal pea coat with fur trim detail; four cream blouses – sheer, but not completely see-through; a cardigan; Hermès silk neck scarves; couple of skinny leather belts – both Prada; a handbag, also Prada; footwear by Salvatore Ferragamo – a pair of heels and knee-high boots for on the ground, and two pairs of ballet pumps to wear in the air.

She told how the work took her from spa resorts to the Caribbean, Dubai to New York, African safaris to theme parks in the US.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘The pay was pretty much the same across the board for freelancers: around $450 in wages, plus $125 in living expenses, per day,’ she explained.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘The only financial drawback was that I no longer had a&nbsp;company credit card, which meant I had to sign up for another one myself.’</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘There tends not to be a chef on the smaller jets, meaning all catering responsibilities are upon the flight attendant. If a client wants fifty bottles of Dom Pérignon, I would need to buy fifty bottles of Dom Pérignon.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘It would also be my duty to buy flowers and any other accessories for the client, as well as buying all of the food and preparing all meals on board. Expenses were later claimed back from the client.’</p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span class="mol-style-bold femail-ccox mol-style-medium">A BILINGUAL PARROT WITH A PENCHANT FOR POTATOES</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font>On board one jet, Saskia and her colleague found themselves catering for Felix, a bilingual African Grey parrot, and Helena, a Siamese cat ‘who came with her own oxygen mask and child life cot, in case of an emergency’.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The cats were brought on the jet, which belonged to a German client, by a doting personal assistant named Samantha.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘Felix had his own little perch attached to a seat, so he could reach the table for dinner,’ Saskia continued. ‘He was wearing a conical restraining collar which was clipped to a harness attached to the seatbelt.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘Gaynor and I were trying not to laugh as Felix, dancing on his perch, kept repeating something, the only words I could decipher possibly being car, toffee and dolphin.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘”Sorry Samantha,” I cut in, “but what is he saying?” “Kartoffel-dauphinoise. It’s German for potato dauphinoise – his favourite dish. The potato gratin from Mastro’s is fine though. You just serve it up in one of his ramekins.”</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘But Helena, explained Samantha, had a palate for turkey and ham.
