The camo-clad Robertson clan at the bull’s-eye of Duck Dynasty went from rags to more rags thanks to success with their Louisiana-based duck-call business, Duck Commander. As you might expect, a family banking on hunting gadgets spends most of their time in the brush, either hunting, fishing, talking about hunting and fishing, breaking up beaver dams (the duck hunter’s arch nemesis), and bringing their kill back to matriarch Ms. Kay for her to fry it up in a pan. Like many reality shows, what started out as naturally funny situations have been manhandled into producer-prodded plotlines and poorly delivered catchphrases meant to sell merch. But throughout the three seasons, one character has remained the show’s saving grace: Uncle Si, a wiry, gray-ponytailed Vietnam vet with an ever-present plastic cup of iced tea in hand and weird wisdom to spare. Below, a collection of Silus Robertson observations.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-0c4c94f671c83ddf6efb6e56b49a6f07-3-0-0@published data-word-count=76><strong>“There ain’t nothin’ finer than rich frogs’ legs taken off of a fine golf course.” — Season one, episode four</strong><br>Si and his brother Phil sneak onto a country club golf course in the middle of the night after discovering its ponds are teeming with plump frogs. These men are in their sixties, clad in camo, wearing night-vision goggles, most definitely trespassing, and doing this for the reward of free frogs they will fry up and eat.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-0c4c94f671c83ddf6efb6e56b49a6f07-4-0-0@published data-word-count=124><strong>“Real-estaters are like a snake in the grass. Hey, you chop his head off, he’ll still bite you. I been snake-bit 27 times to be exact. Hey, that’s what they do! They’re being a snake!” — Season one, episode eight</strong><br>Matriarch Ms. Kay wants to parlay the family’s success into a new house, so she talks Phil into checking out a few places with a realtor. Si tags along, backing up his brother Phil that the realtor is trying to take the redneck out of him and stick him in a McMansion in a subdivision, something Phil likens to the kiss of death because a yuppie man “won’t be able to take a leak in his own yard without someone saying, ‘Hey, what’s he doing?’”</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-0c4c94f671c83ddf6efb6e56b49a6f07-5-0-0@published data-word-count=132><strong>“This thing is gonna be a humdinger. I’m talking ‘bout this thing is gonna be a pants-off dance-off, Jack. We fixing to have a hootenanny like you ain’t had in your lifetime. Hey, this is going to be like the wedding from Deer Hunter. Hey, this thing is gonna be good.” — Season two, episode 24</strong><br>A Japanese business associate of Deer Commander gifts the boys with a samurai sword, so they immediately take it into the warehouse in search of stuff to destroy. Si is beside himself with excitement over the possibilities and says the above line before running around scrounging up anything in sight that can be sliced up: cardboard boxes, tree stumps, and … a watermelon. Because, you know, all rednecks and Gallagher fans always have a watermelon on hand.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-0c4c94f671c83ddf6efb6e56b49a6f07-6-0-0@published data-word-count=51><strong>“I’m the Michael Jordan of getting on people’s nerves. You think you made a move on me? Nah. I’m like fingernails on a chalkboard. I’m on your nerves, big time.” — Season three, episode seven</strong><br>Si randomly decides to annoy the shit out of his nephew Willie while he’s driving. Just cause.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-0c4c94f671c83ddf6efb6e56b49a6f07-7-0-0@published data-word-count=103><b>“There’s two things that Silus Robertson really knows, okay. That’s ’nam, okay, and good pizza. I’ve not met a pizza I didn’t like, but look, hey, this pizza place is like the Karate Kid of pizza, Jack. This is the best pizza around, hey, nothing’s ever gonna keep it down.” — Season three, episode seven</b><br>For some reason, Si is convinced that the pizza at Excalibur, a local kid’s arcade-slash-pizza-parlor, is the best in town, plus he really wants to win a purple gorilla with Skee-Ball and Pop-A-Shot tickets. What old man <i>wouldn’t</i> want to bring home a giant, stinky, scratchy stuffed animal?</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-0c4c94f671c83ddf6efb6e56b49a6f07-8-0-0@published data-word-count=65><strong>“Hey, look here, I’m gonna let you in on one of my big secrets, okay.

Cue the Daddy’s-little-girl scenario as Willie freaks over the short hem. Si couldn’t care less. He has Billy Joel to quote.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-0c4c94f671c83ddf6efb6e56b49a6f07-10-0-0@published data-word-count=133><strong>“You don’t want a dog who thinks he’s too fancy for the work you want him to do. Hey, you get a dog like that and, next thing you know, you’ll both be getting matching pedicures.” — Season three, episode 26</strong><br>The guys are dove hunting (giving Si a golden opportunity for corny Prince jokes via “When Doves Cry”), and Si’s dog isn’t retrieving, so he goes shopping for a new hunting dog, ultimately ending up with a poodle. Phil contests that a real man doesn’t want to be seen driving around with a poodle in his truck, until the dog proves he has “real cods” by being one hell of a retriever. As Phil says “cods,” the camera zooms in on the dogs nuts, so … apparently cods means balls in the swamp.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-0c4c94f671c83ddf6efb6e56b49a6f07-11-0-0@published data-word-count=33><strong>“Hey, look here, a dog’s just like a car or a mattress or a tree.
