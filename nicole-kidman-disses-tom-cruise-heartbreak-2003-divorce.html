She had to be convinced to attend the afterparty.</p><p>“I’m not a big party girl, so I was going to skip the Vanity Fair party, and everyone was like, ‘You’ve got to go. You’ve got to walk through the party carrying your Academy Award,’" Kidman continued. "I said, ‘That just feels like gloating, and it doesn’t feel humble.’ Like, what? You can’t walk through carrying the award! That feels really inappropriate. They’re like, ‘That’s what you do.’"</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Nicole went on, “So I literally walked in, carried it around, was completely overwhelmed, emotional, shaking, and I didn’t enjoy it.

Nicole says eating take-out by herself following the Oscars made her realize she wanted to find love again – Nicole would go on to marry country singer Keith Urban in 2006.

"I sat on the floor of the hotel eating French fries and a burger with my family and went to bed. That’s when it hit me. I went, I need to find my love; I need a love in my life.
