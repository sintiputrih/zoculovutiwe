This terrible accident left Josh with severe, life-threatening injuries.</span></p><p><span><a href=# data-slb-active=1 data-slb-asset=566108761 data-slb-group=57290><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/galaxylands.com.vn/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/josh-moonshiners-motorcycle-accident.webp alt width=750 height=448 sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></span></p><h3><span>Development of the accident</span></h3><p><span>At around 3:00 p.m. on March 4, Josh Moonshiners and some teammates participated in a traditional motorbike race at the Daytona racetrack. This is one of the most dangerous and challenging racetracks in the world.</span></p><p><span>During a sharp turn around the top of the pass, Josh’s motorbike suddenly lost control and crashed straight into the safety fence of the racetrack. The strong impact caused him to be thrown away and fall to the ground.</span></p><p><span>According to witnesses at the scene, Josh’s head and chest hit the road hard before sliding several meters on the rough road surface. Blood splashed, the victim lay motionless in a coma and convulsions.</span></p><h3><span>Severe injury</span></h3><p><span>After being taken to the emergency hospital, doctors determined that Josh had serious injuries to his neck, back, arms and legs. Specifically:</span></p><ul><li><span>Fractured 3 cervical vertebrae</span></li><li><span>Broken 2 ribs</span></li><li><span>Fractured right forearm</span></li><li><span>A total of 7 left leg fractures</span></li></ul><p><span>In addition, Josh’s brain and internal organs were also seriously damaged by the strong impact. The doctor said it was a miracle that Josh could survive the accident. Currently, he is still in a coma and on a ventilator.</span></p><h3><span>Reunite with family</span></h3><p><span>After hearing the news, Josh’s wife, children and relatives immediately flew from Los Angeles to Florida to take care of and encourage him. The family was filled with fear and suffering when they saw their relative lying motionless in the ICU special care room.</span></p><p><span>However, they still maintain faith that Josh will wake up soon. In particular, the wife was moved at her husband’s bedside, affirming that she would stay by his side and take care of him at all costs until he completely recovered.</span></p><h3><span>Mobilize charitable donations</span></h3><p><span>Josh’s treatment and surgery costs are estimated to be hundreds of thousands of dollars. However, he does not have health insurance. That’s why Josh’s friends and fans launched a fundraising campaign on the GoFundMe page.</span></p><p><span>Up to now, the campaign has attracted more than 5,000 supporters and raised nearly 300,000 USD. This amount of money will help Josh’s family feel secure in taking care of him for a long time to come.</span></p><p><span>Through this heartbreaking story, we need to be more aware of the potential dangers of illegal racing. At the same time, please share your love with Josh as well as other traffic accident victims. Wishing Josh will soon overcome the danger and return to normal life.</span></p><p><span class="post-views-icon dashicons dashicons-chart-bar"></span> <span class=post-views-label>Post Views:</span> <span class=post-views-count>34</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifkaGuucXLmqWdq16YvK561admo6ejnXquu86nqqGhnpq%2FtHnMqKuoqpOusK2xjJqanKGUmru1ew%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./holly-holm-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Holly Holm's Net Worth (Updated 2024)</span></a>
