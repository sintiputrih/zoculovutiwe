Let's face it, with ten seasons and 236 episodes in the books, things were bound to go a little bit southwards in terms of storylines.</p><p>Via Reddit,<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">there is a lot of talk</a> in regards to the worst season in the show's history. We're used to the opposite, reliving moments like, "I got off the plane," or, "It's always been you, Rach."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>This topic is a different beast. Fans seem to agree with a certain moment being labeled amongst the very worst. Not only was the scene uncomfortable to watch, but it also almost destroyed Monica's character, given how unlike her the scene really was.</p><p>We'll take a look at the scene in question, along with taking a deeper look at <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Courteney Cox's</a> time on the show, which was filled with uncertainty.</p><h2 id=cox-turned-down-rachel-for-monica>Cox Turned Down Rachel For Monica</h2><p>Just because you're offered a role doesn't mean that role is for you. Credit to Courteney Cox, who was well aware early on.</p><p>She was supposed to audition for Rachel, though ultimately, as she revealed with Today,<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Cox felt more in-tune with the Monica character.&nbsp;</a></p><p>“For some reason, I thought I related more to Monica, which maybe it’s because I do,” she explained.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED -&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Courteney Cox Nearly Played This 'Friends' Character Instead Of Monica</a></span></p><p>“I’m very similar to her ... I’m not as clean as Monica, but I am neat. And I’m not as competitive, even though some people, my partner (musician) Johnny McDaid, would say I am.”</p><p>She landed the role but as it turns out, her biggest storyline on the show was never planned and in fact, it was only meant as a short-term plot.</p><h2 id=chandler-amp-monica-was-never-the-long-term-plan>Chandler & Monica Was Never The Long-Term Plan</h2><p>Getting both Monica and Chandler together was a major shift in both their characters. According to People, the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">chatter of putting the two alongside one another</a> started as early as season 2. Though it was meant to be loose and nothing serious.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“When the second season was being planned, one of the writers tossed out an idea: ‘What if we get Chandler and Monica together?"</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED -&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Fans Think This Is The Reason Why Joey And Phoebe Never Got Together On 'Friends'</a></span></p><p>“The thought was intended less as a permanent shift in the gravity of the series and more as a fun plotline, good for a few episodes before the status quo snapped back into place.”</p><p>The reaction from the audience was the real game-changer, everyone buzzed when Monica came up from under the covers. This caused everyone to reconsider the casual fling.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“When Monica popped up from beneath the sheets, there was just this explosion from the audience,” he said. “It was a combination of a laugh/gasp/cry/shriek. They were just blown away by it.</p><p>Organically, they became a couple and grew together on the show. However, as it turns out, fans didn't like everything that the two did alongside one another. One particular scene is labeled as the very worst.</p><h2 id=spending-chandler-s-money>Spending Chandler's Money</h2><p>Looking back, it was sort of an out-of-character moment for Monica. When asked via Reddit, which 'Friends' scene is the worst, this one is the most heavily voted.</p><p>The scene features Monica and Chandler discussing the wedding. Once Monica finds out about Chandler's income, she turns very shallow. In the eyes of many fans, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">it was hard to watch</a> and it hurt Monica's persona.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The fans chimed in with their thoughts on the scene.</p><p>"The episode where Monica is talking about spending Chandler's money on a wedding. It's just so cringy for me to see her being so shallow."</p><p>"Like what kind of person would actually want their fiancée to spend their life savings on their wedding?? It doesn't make sense for Monica who would be very into planning for their future."</p><p>"Yeah, this one is always hard to watch. If I was in Chandler's position I'd be furious."</p><p>"It makes no sense, especially for Monica."</p><p>Without a doubt, the scene in question might've been changed with a little more thought - especially given that it wasn't a characteristic of Monica's.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>We're sure she shrugged off the scene, however, behind the scenes, she did face certain struggles.</p><p>One of them was being the only main cast member to not be nominated for an Emmy.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=cox-was-hurting-behind-the-scenes>Cox Was Hurting Behind The Scenes</h2><p>During its decade-long run, 'Friends' got nominated for more than a few Emmy Awards, 16 to be exact. Turns out, five of the main cast members were up for the awards, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Cox was the only one never to be considered.</a></p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED -&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Here's Why This 'Friends' Guest Star Acted Like A Jerk On Set</a></span></p><p>As she revealed alongside Howard Stern, that was a hard reality she faced behind the scenes.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"It always hurt my feelings," Cox said. "When every single cast member was nominated but me, it definitely hurt my feelings. I was happy for everybody, and then when it was finally like, 'Oh, I'm the only one?' It hurt."</p><p>"I wanted my peers to respect me and I know that the Golden Globes is not your peers, necessarily, but it's like, 'Ah!' It took a little of the sting out."</p><p>Credit to Cox, she finally got her special moment after season 1 of 'Cougar Town' at the Golden Globes.</p><p>"The only thing that made me feel good — because they've all won and they've gotten so many accolades — I got nominated for 'Cougar Town' the first year [out] — a Golden Globe. And I want to say, 'Oh, who cares?' It meant everything to me."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Despite the ups and downs of the show, we can all agree, Monica's legacy is nothing but a positive.</p><p>We can't imagine anyone else in the role.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT -&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Fans Think This Is The Most Embarrassing Moment In ‘Friends’ History</a></span></p><p>Sources: Insider, Reddit, People & Today</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiroZ1doryusc2tZKannp6wor%2BMnJ%2BaqpGYwaa%2BjLCYrGWRobqwv9Nmm56rpKe8urHDZqanZZantqa6w6xm</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./obituary-jacquelyn-fonte-homer-glen-murder-suicide-death.html><span>←</span><span>Obituary: Jacquelyn Fonte Homer Glen Murder Suicide Linked To Death</span></a>
