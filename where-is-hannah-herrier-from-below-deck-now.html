Many fans speculated that her dismissal was connected to her onboard use of CBD and Valium. However, the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">real reason behind her departure</a> was her lack of trustworthiness and inability to perform effectively while not sober.

A few years after the stewardess left the deck, Ferrier and her then-boyfriend Josh Roberts, an acclaimed author, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">announced the born of their first child together</a>, daughter Ava Grace Roberts. Not long after, the couple tied the knot in a loving beach ceremony after four years of dating.</p><p data-characters=486 data-current-count=486 data-injectable=true>During this time, the star also kept a relatively active social media presence, becoming well-known for her fitness journey as she opened up about losing the baby weight, opening up about her fitness goals, and the entire journey with her health and her newfound love for the gym life. Aside from social media, the influencer has also kept a successful podcast afloat, titled Dear Reality, You’re Effed!, which currently holds an incredibly high rating on her <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Apple podcast page</a>.</p><p data-characters=440 data-current-count=440 data-injectable=true>As for reality tv, Ferrier announced her return to television on June 2022.
