Let’s have a look at the article below.</p><h2 id=arrested-who-is-raheem-ramsarran-that-punched-a-9-year-old-kid>Arrested: Who Is Raheem Ramsarran That Punched A 9 Year Old Kid?</h2><p>Raheem Ramsarran is a 27-year-old man who punched a young 9-year-old kid on 21 March 2022.</p><p>No, he has not been arrested though he is detained in the police station. In fact, Raheem&nbsp;is described as an emotionally disturbed thug or crazy man by the news media.</p><p>The assaulted victim was a young tourist girl who was allegedly hit without reason on the left side of the head when she was on her way with her &nbsp;Yelena Contreras Molerio to visit the Big Apple in New York while walking near Central Park.</p><p>From&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener>The New York Post</a>, we learned that Raheem is currently in custody and the inquiry process is still ongoing. It is reportedly found that the assaulter has not revealed the real reason for hitting the tourist girl. But, this incident has more or less placed a psychological trauma on the young girl, who was punched for nothing.</p><p>As per the reports, after being detained by the police and having no way to flee, he started calling the cops.</p><h2 id=who-is-neil-johnson-helped-catch-raheem-ramsarran>Who Is Neil Johnson Helped Catch Raheem Ramsarran?</h2><p>Neil Johnson, a Plaza Hotel employee, assisted in catching Raheem Ramsarran and preventing him from causing any further mischief.</p><p>Neil, 60, was working as a doorman at a prestigious luxury hotel when he heard yelling and other loud noises. He went to the scene because he thought something was amiss and noticed the woman screaming and fleeing from Raheem, while Raheem was chasing the mother and daughter pair. As a result, Johnson stood between the girl and Ramsarran, the “mad guy,” and saved the day.</p><p>Neil, who has worked at the Plaza Hotel for 24 years, said he had never seen something as unpleasant as this and felt sorry for the young child.</p><p>And, for his bravery and courageous move of saving the girl from Ramsarran, people have even started considering him as a hero.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue8KroKadX6y1sHnIrGSrmZiasq550ZqkrJmip66vecCrqZ6rpJqxbrLOq2SprZ6Ytaq6xmaYZnFdrrKivoyoo51n</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./278066-tory-lanezs-michael-jackson-costume-and-impression-is-low-key-terrifying-news.html><span>←</span><span>Tory Lanez's Michael Jackson Costume &amp;amp; Impression Is Low-Key Terrifying</span></a>
