Donning a vibrant blue long-sleeve mididress embellished with silver sparkles and sequin appliqués, the dress featured a cutout detail on the bodice and a diagonal hem. She paired the star-studded dress with a pair of metallic silver open-toed platform heels and a matching clutch.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Adding her signature touch of glam, Salma accessorized with diamond stud earrings, as well as a pair of gunmetal blue aviator sunglasses. Her hair was worn down in a straight style with a middle part, and she combined a sultry smoky eye with rosy cheeks and pink lips.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_9-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner readability=27><p>Daniele Venturelli/Getty Images for Gucci</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">It was a family affair for Hayek in Milan. She was joined by her husband, French billionaire François-Henri Pinault, and daughters Mathilde and Valentina Paloma Pinault. Just a week ago, she revealed that she didn't know she was getting married the day of their wedding. "I had a phobia of the marriage thing," Hayek told <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Glamour</a>. "I didn't even know I was getting married that day. It was like an intervention. They just took me to the court. My parents, my brother, they were all ganging up on me." Hayek and Pinault married on Valentine's Day in 2009, two years after they welcomed their daughter Valentina.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">She continued, "The reason why it was a courthouse wedding was because they dragged me there. I was nervous. And then after, there was a lunch at his parents' house. My mother-in-law, who's the most tasteful person when it comes to entertaining, had already been doing the lunch. I had no choice."<br></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK570pqjppldna66scpmqq2ZomKxs7HSrGSmoZyWu26ywKyfoqeeYsSmscpmnq6bk556tLTOsGRwaWFognmA</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./josh-moonshiners-motorcycle-accident.html><span>←</span><span>Josh Moonshiners motorcycle accident</span></a>
