Still, Breakker&nbsp; charged back up to hit a Frankensteiner and a double underhook powerbomb. He then went for his gorilla press finisher, but Ciampa escaped and planted his opponent with an inverted DDT.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Past, present and future.</p><p>@NXTCiampa & <a href=#>@bronbreakkerwwe</a> are leaving it all on the mat for the <a href=#>#NXTChampionship</a>. <a href=#>#HalloweenHavoc</a> <a href=#>#WWENXT</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/FTfHnEsJ8W</a></p><p>— WWE (@WWE) <a href=#>October 27, 2021</a></p><p>Ciampa firmly turned the momentum in his corner when he DDT’ed Breakker on the open concrete at ringside. A bloody Breakker got back to his feet, only to get nailed with a Fairy-tale Ending, but he somehow kicked out. Several nasty knees to the head and a second Fairytale Ending ultimately put down Breakker for the 1-2-3 and ended his hopes of enjoying a fairy0tale ending on Tuesday night.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uL7ErKulnaqku6Z6wqikaKaVrMBwfZFvaWluY2LBsLnMmqqoZZOerq68wGaZq6eeYq%2BzscCkop6qXaPFtXnHmqOlp6easq95x5qtqJs%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./chunky-jewellery.html><span>←</span><span>The 8 best pieces of chunky jewellery to add to cart right now</span></a>
