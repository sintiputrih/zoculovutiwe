As he attempts to revitalize his music career, Safaree has dropped several&nbsp;<a href=# rel>singles</a> this year. The big news, however, had to do with his&nbsp;<a href=# rel>nude photos leaking</a> onto the web. Who would have thought that Safaree had the power to break the internet in 2018? He effectively did so when his nudes were unwillingly uploaded to social media. While he consistently <a href=# rel>denies his involvement in the leak</a>, he tried to capitalize on the random burst of exposure to get his money up.&nbsp;</p><p>Nicki and Safaree were coupled up for twelve years before they went their separate&nbsp;ways. He was an important part of her rise to superstardom, often acting as her hypeman and motivating her offscreen as her longtime partner. Although things may have soured between the two of them, Safaree is still reaping the benefits of his work on Pink Friday, Minaj's 2010 debut album. As his July 4 birthday nears, Safaree shared an image of a check he received out of the blue, paying him for his contributions to two of Nicki's tracks. Revealing a total payout of over $2.3K, the musician received a nice little bonus to bring in a new year of his life.&nbsp;</p><p>There is very little chance for a reconciliation between the two so the money he's still getting for "Roman's Revenge" and "Did It On 'Em" eight years after their releases is definitely cause for celebration. Happy birthday, Safaree!</p><p><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.instagram.com/p/Bkxyqg2g4hw</a><br></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvTp5ywoJmltbC8jZympmdhZYZ4gZRmqpqekaeypnnSmqSunZyoerTAyKWjZqWRoLavs4yrprKZnKm2pr%2BMn6mopV2svLO3jLCgraBdo7akt8hmpKKmkZ96r7HWrA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./nadine-milad-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-144426-html.html><span>←</span><span>Nadine Milad Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</span></a>
