As contract extension negotiations stall, the Mets are reportedly open to the idea of trading Alonso. This article will delve into the factors surrounding the potential trade, including Alonso's asking price, his value as a player, and the Mets' recent roster moves.</p><p data-mce-fragment=1>Alonso's agent, Scott Boras, has made it clear that his client is seeking a contract extension offer from the Mets this offseason. Boras, known for taking his players into free agency to secure higher contracts, is pushing for a deal that reflects Alonso's value. The first baseman's asking price is reportedly higher than recent deals for other first basemen, which could be a sticking point in the negotiations. However, Alonso's hitting ability and potential to transition to a designated hitter make him an attractive player despite concerns about his defense.</p><p data-mce-fragment=1>With contract extension negotiations at a standstill, the Mets are exploring the possibility of trading Alonso. The team's previous high spending did not yield the desired results, leading to a cautious approach when it comes to committing to long-term contracts. The Mets recently traded their top two starting pitchers, Justin Verlander and Max Scherzer, signaling a shift in focus towards the future. These trades also brought in prospects, setting up the Mets for potential success down the line.</p><p data-mce-fragment=1>Although Alonso had a down season, the Mets remain hopeful that he can bounce back next year. The first baseman has shown tremendous power and offensive prowess in the past, making him a valuable asset for any team. His ability to hit for both average and power has made him a fan favorite and a key contributor to the Mets' lineup. However, his defensive skills have raised some concerns, which might impact his trade value. Nonetheless, the potential for Alonso to transition to a designated hitter role in the American League adds to his appeal.</p><p data-mce-fragment=1>If the Mets decide to trade Alonso, several teams could emerge as potential suitors. The need for a power-hitting first baseman or designated hitter could make Alonso an attractive target for teams looking to boost their offense. Additionally, teams in need of a middle-of-the-order bat might be interested in acquiring Alonso's services. However, the Mets' asking price for their star player might deter some potential suitors, considering his reported higher asking price.</p><p data-mce-fragment=1>As the contract extension negotiations between Pete Alonso and the New York Mets stall, trade rumors surrounding the star first baseman continue to swirl. While Alonso's asking price and defensive concerns might impact his trade value, his offensive abilities and potential to transition to a designated hitter role make him an attractive player for potential suitors. The Mets, having recently traded their top starting pitchers, are positioning themselves for the future, and a trade involving Alonso could further solidify their long-term plans. Only time will tell if the Mets will ultimately trade their superstar or find common ground in contract extension negotiations.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiekaOus6%2FHZ5qopV%2BXubCz0midmqZdlr%2BktI6mo5tloqq6sL6MrZ%2BeZZ2awbR5zJqwZqSfpLhuwM5mq6uZlJp6sbHTnmSapJ%2BjwLA%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./1343694-mandy-rose-hasnt-ruled-out-returning-to-wrestling-expresses-her-interest-in-dancing-with-the-stars.html><span>←</span><span>Mandy Rose Hasnt Ruled Out Returning To Wrestling, Expresses Her Interest in Dancing With The</span></a>
