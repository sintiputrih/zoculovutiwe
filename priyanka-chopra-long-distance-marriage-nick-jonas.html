It was really, really tough to be away from home for an entire year, especially at a time when you can't travel to see your family," she said, per <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://people.com/tv/priyanka-chopra-how-she-nick-jonas-make-marriage-work-long-distance/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=People class="body-link css-1xesb7e emevuu60">People</a>. "Just the uncertainty of my mom and my brother being in India, my husband being in America while I was in the U.K. It just was so much uncertainty and that, to me, was terrifying of not being able to just get on a flight and travel, just in case something went wrong or something happened. But thankfully, you know, everyone was okay."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=5 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">She explained that having to quarantine every time they saw each other could potentially throw a wrench in their professional schedules. "We didn't have a dramatic separation but because he was in and out, we had to be really careful. He had to quarantine, I had to quarantine whenever we saw each other at that time," she said. "And that's usually not conducive to a production schedule because you don't really have much time. You have, like, two days off."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Despite the extra challenges put forth by the pandemic, the actress said that she and Jonas made it work and that they "talk all the time."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"It was all really tricky but we managed. He flew down a bunch of times, I flew down a couple of times. My mom came and stayed with me for almost five months, which was really nice," she said. "We know each other's hearts and we prioritize each other in everything that we do. We've had individual careers and we're both very clear about never interfering in each other's professional lives because we're always partners and assets. We'll have an opinion on each other's things, we'll be each other champions but those decisions are predominantly for both of us to take, because we've built our careers by ourselves for such a long time."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">And while they're both understanding and supportive of each other's careers, the couple still know when to prioritize their relationship over everything else.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"It's very important to keep a check on another person's heart and how they're feeling. And I have to say, my husband's amazing at doing that," she shared. "Like I said, this year was hard for me being in London. He would just drop everything—come in for even, like a day—just to have dinner with me and fly back. Stuff like that, you just have to prioritize each other and then everything feels right."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Chopra and Jonas first got <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/celebrity/latest/a22572681/nick-jonas-priyanka-chopra-engaged/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="engaged in July 2018" class="body-link css-1xesb7e emevuu60">engaged in July 2018</a>, then <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/celebrity/latest/a25107771/priyanka-chopra-nick-jonas-wedding-details/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="married in a multiday celebration" class="body-link css-1xesb7e emevuu60">married in a multiday celebration</a> by the end of the year.</p><span class="css-3mrz81 ev8dhu51"><img src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/1025b301-1f7f-4f4b-80fe-228ddf464aff_1642017719.file?fill=1:1&resize=120:*" alt="Headshot of Chelsey Sanchez" title="Headshot of Chelsey Sanchez" width=100% height=100% decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p>As an associate editor at HarpersBAZAAR.com, Chelsey keeps a finger on the pulse on all things celeb news.
