Morgan <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/pictures/hilarie-burton-jeffrey-dean-morgans-public-declarations-of-love/>revealed</a>:</p><p class=dh>"Jensen said, 'I've got a girl you should meet.' So I went to a bar and I met Hilarie at a bar with Jensen and Danneel, and the rest is history."</p><p class=dh>That night,<a class="me a" href=#> Morgan</a> convinced Burton, who was on the eve of a trip to Paris to come with him to Mexico instead, where he was making the movie, "The Resident." <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.eonline.com/news/1106711/hilarie-burton-reflects-on-jeffrey-dean-morgan-romance-in-moving-message>The trip put a seal on the relationship</a>, and soon Burton was expecting their first child.</p><p class=dh><strong class=bh>DELIVERING GUS</strong></p><p class=dh>On March 14, 2010, Morgan was right there by Burton's side in the delivery room. The plan had been for Morgan to play a supporting role in the delivery, but at the last moment, the midwife pushed the actor into the action. He <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.accessonline.com/articles/jeffrey-dean-morgan-opens-about-delivering-both-his-children>confessed</a>:</p><p class=dh>“I thought I was just there to lend support, hold the leg [but] as soon as the baby started crowning, they kinda just pushed me in there.”</p><p class=dh><strong class=bh>HEARTBREAK</strong></p><p class=dh>A year and a half after they started trying to conceive again, Burton was delighted to discover she was pregnant. She <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.instagram.com/p/Bf_cxoPhaq3/>confided</a>:</p><p class=dh>"We cried. We celebrated. We picked out names. And we lost that baby.”</p><p class=dh>Over the next 3 years, Burton and Morgan suffered through the agony of losing several more longed-for babies, and then in 2017, the actress found herself pregnant again. Fearful of losing yet another baby, the couple kept the pregnancy a secret.</p><p class=dh>Burton admitted that she had wanted no possible jinx on the pregnancy, and had no baby shower, no celebration. Up unto the delivery, Burton had her baby's heartbeat checked every single day. Then on February 16, 2018, she went into labor.</p><p class=dh><strong class=bh>JEFFREY DEAN MORGAN STEPS IN</strong></p><p class=dh>Of course, Morgan was there, right by her side through the whole ordeal once again, and this time he was experienced at the whole procedure.</p><p class=dh>He revealed that when Gus was born, he had waited too long to pull him out, and the baby boy's head was "shaped like a cone." With his second delivery, there was no mistake, Morgan <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.accessonline.com/articles/jeffrey-dean-morgan-opens-about-delivering-both-his-children>said</a>:</p><p class=dh>“As soon as she crowned, I grabbed her a little by the cheeks and pulled her out – perfect.”</p><p class=dh><strong class=bh>A GIRL NAMED GEORGE</strong></p><p class=dh>George Virginia Morgan,<a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://people.com/parents/jeffrey-dean-morgan-delivered-daughter-george-name/> as her parents named her,</a> is now two years old, and a bundle of energy. As to her unusual name, it turns out that both Morgan and Burton loved the iconic western series "Bonanza" and, in particular, an episode titled "A Girl Named George." Morgan <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://people.com/parents/jeffrey-dean-morgan-delivered-daughter-george-name/>quipped</a>:</p><p class=dh>"Gus is named after Augustus McCrae in Lonesome Dove.

Morgan has recently seen the premiere of two films, "The Postcard Killings," and "Walkaway Joe," both released in 2020.</p><p class=dh>Morgan is currently filming another film, "The Shrine," based on the horror novel by James Herbert and co-starring Katie Aselton, William Sadler, Diogo Morgado, and Cary Elwes.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlazAb63MqKSapZFjsLC5jmtpbHFja3qrscWfqZ6xXZmyorqMpqarn5GjeqWxy6KtnqqVmXqju9OhZKGho2K4b7TTpqM%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./dennis-rodmans-tragic-real-life-story.html><span>←</span><span>Dennis Rodman's Tragic Real-Life Story</span></a>
