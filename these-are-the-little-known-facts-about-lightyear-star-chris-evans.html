Even after playing one of the heroes in the Marvel Series, there are more facts to be revealed about this actor. There are interesting facts that are yet to be revealed by adorable actor Chris Evans in his <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">new and trending movie Lightyear.</a> Although the <a href=#>actor is now a widely known star in Hollywood</a>, there are things that the fans and public probably did not know about him yet. Take a look at these little known facts about the actor.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# title="Chris Evans Continues To Confuse Fans, But Lightyear Was Never Meant To Be About The Toy">Chris Evans Continues To Confuse Fans, But Lightyear Was Never Meant To Be About The Toy</a></span></p><h2 id=his-brother-is-also-an-actor><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>His Brother Is Also An Actor</span></h2><p>Scott Evans is the younger brother of Chris Evans, and he is an actor. Not as famous as his brother, Captain America, but he is starting to make his name in Hollywood. According to IMDB, Scott has had brief appearances on TV episodes like USA's White Collar, NBC's Law, and Order: Criminal Intent, and Fox's Fringe. He recently appeared in the comedy Almost Love and played Oliver in the Netflix series Grace and Frankie (2019).</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=his-father-is-a-dentist><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>His Father Is A Dentist</span></h2><p>Chris Evans' teeth are impressive white, not the product of Hollywood unrealism. But it is thanks to his hands-on father.<a href=#> On Jimmy Fallon's show</a> in 2011, Evans revealed that he is bleeding to have a father who is a dentist. Fortunate, as he grew older, he appeared to be the village idiot with teeth attempting to escape his face. Evans continued by saying that he later had clear braces to assist him in fixing his smile.</p><h2 id=he-once-starred-in-one-of-marilyn-manson-rsquo-s-music-video><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>He Once Starred in One of Marilyn Manson’s Music Video</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Could you believe Evans starred in the Tainted Love music video by Marilyn Manson in 2001 alongside his Not Another Teen Movie co-star Jaime Pressly and Eric Christian Olsen? In fact, in the video, Manson can be seen entering the "not another adolescent party" and you can see the teen actress pushing a young Evans out of the way.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# title="Here's The Truth About 'Scott Pilgrim V.S.

Evans was chosen to play Johnny Storm, a.k.a. the Human Torch, in the 2005 movie Fantastic Four. But unfortunately, The Guardian reports that neither critics nor moviegoers liked this movie or its sequel movie, Fantastic 4: Rise of the Silver Surf (2007). Although he is now widely known as a hero in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, he has played villain as well in the film <a href=#>Scott Pilgrim vs. the World</a> where he portrayed the character of Scott Lee who is the rival of Michael Cera’s character.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=he-starred-in-a-short-educational-film><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>He Starred In A Short Educational Film</span></h2><p>Evans, who was 16 at the time, the Avengers actor, started his career with a 1997 short educational film called Biodiversity: Wild About Life, in addition to school performances and neighborhood theater productions. His next acting opportunity opened 3 years later with the Fox miniseries Opposite Sex in 2000.</p><h2 id=he-is-called-captain-little-ass-on-set><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>He Is Called Captain Little Ass On Set</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Chris Evans revealed that Anthony "Falcon Big Butt" Mackie gave him the on-set nickname "Captain Little Ass" during a 2014 interview with Entertainment Tonight. The pet moniker was intended as a jab at his extreme workout regimen and ensuing body.</p><h3></h3><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# title="Sebastian Stan and Anthony Mackie Are 'Taking A Break' From Their Bromance">Sebastian Stan and Anthony Mackie Are 'Taking A Break' From Their Bromance</a></span></p><h2 id=passionate-towards-tap-dancing><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Passionate Towards Tap Dancing</span></h2><p>Evans has stated that his mother taught him how to tap dance, and he frequently discusses his passion for tap dancing in interviews. In 2017, he even demonstrated his abilities on an episode of The Ellen DeGeneres Show. Needless to say, the actor also has some dancing skills he is yet to show and use in his future films.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=he-has-a-huge-crush-on-sandra-bullock><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>He Has A Huge Crush On Sandra Bullock</span></h2><p>The actor admitted to having a childhood love for Sandra Bullock after seeing her in the movie Speed in a 2016 interview with W magazine (1994).

He claimed that he initially declined Marvel because he did not want to become "can't-go-outside famous." His greatest worry, according to Lisa, was losing his incognito. He declared that he now has a career where he can do what he enjoys. He can do everyday things like go on a dog walk, and nobody annoys him. And, because he has few friends, he is free to travel wherever. He was worried that he might lose that freedom and kind of leisure. However, her mother eventually talked to and convinced him to take the role. Good thing he accepted the role as the American actor is now having fun hanging out with his Avengers cast mates. Evans and colleague actress Scarlett Johansson intend to get matching tattoos with the original Avengers cast members to commemorate the release of Avengers: Infinity Wars, according to Entertainment Weekly (2019).</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>READ NEXT: <a href=# title="This 'Pulp Fiction' Easter Egg Appeared In 'Captain America: The Winter Soldier'">This 'Pulp Fiction' Easter Egg Appeared In 'Captain America: The Winter Soldier'</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiroZ2jmnqivsRmq6GdXaG2tcDLnmSkpp%2Bsu26ywJyrrGWRl7y2wIyloKCgpK6yor6MrKuaql2YtbO10macr5meqHw%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./your-guide-to-building-the-perfect-hogwarts-legacy-wand.html><span>←</span><span>Your guide to building the perfect Hogwarts Legacy wand</span></a>
