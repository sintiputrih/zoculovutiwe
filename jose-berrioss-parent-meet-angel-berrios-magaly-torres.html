Although he grew up in Puerto Rico, this young man had a keen interest in baseball from a young age. He began dedicating himself to the sport because he knew that it was going to be his way out. His hard work paid off when this young pitcher was selected in the first round of the 2012 Major League Baseball draft.</p><p>The Minnesota Twins picked him as the 32nd overall pick that year. A two-time All-Star, he made his professional debut with the Rookie-level Gulf Coast Twins in 2012 before being promoted to the Rookie-level Appalachian League’s Elizabethton Twins. La Maquina has also played for the Class A Midwest League’s Cedar Rapids Kernels, the Class A-Advanced Florida State League’s Fort Myers Miracle, the Class AA Eastern League’s New Britain Rock Cats, the Class AAA International League’s Rochester Red Wings, and the Class AA Southern League’s Chattanooga Lookouts. The Twins gave him his MLB debut against the Cleveland Indians on April 27, 2016. La Maquina remained with them until 2021.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLTGqKqsoaBjsLC5jqOmrJ1dl7KzvsioqqxloJa%2FprrTZqSenaRirq%2BzxKVkm52ip7awv4ymmKCZnK56tbvRq5ysZw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./gothfield-creator-honored-by-sexy-goth-garfield-memes-popularity.html><span>←</span><span>Gothfield creator honored by sexy-goth-Garfield memes popularity</span></a>
