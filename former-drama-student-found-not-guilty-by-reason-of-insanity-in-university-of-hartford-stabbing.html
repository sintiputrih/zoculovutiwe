Both were transported to area hospitals - one in critical condition, the other stable - for treatment of wounds suffered as the three reportedly acted out a scene from a movie for a class assignment.</p><p>Both students suffered stab wounds to their chest and back, police noted. Wascher initially fled the apartment on foot before being apprehended. He was later treated for non-life-threatening injuries as a precaution.</p><p>“We are deeply saddened by the serious incident involving the assault of two students on campus this afternoon,” the University posted in a statement following the stabbing. “The injured students were immediately transported to area hospitals for treatment and law enforcement secured campus. A third student (Wascher) was located off-campus and has been taken into police custody. Our thoughts are with these students and their families during this difficult time.</p><p class=e-click-here-follow-btn data-testid=bottom-paragraph><a class=e-email-signup js-follow-button data-testid=article-click-here-to-subscribe href=#>Click here</a> to follow Daily Voice Fairfield and receive free news updates.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmickZ65usLOopqeZpOkunCvzqelnpuknrC2wI6fmKKqlp6yrbCOp5ywq1%2BbvLO5xKtknaqRoq5uv9Oum56mpGKzsMHNnWSnp6RitLa1y62wZpqpYr%2BmrdKopWanlmK2r7%2FAp6CtsV2eu27BzaKtnqqjnsG6ec6fZKGZoqmzsL7DZqqtmZKXtq%2BzjnBucWljaHw%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./fall.html><span>←</span><span>Favorite Fall Squash Recipes</span></a>
