With odds ranging from Purple (+225) to Clear/Water (+1000), this bet adds a colorful and suspenseful element to the post-game festivities. Based on historical trends, orange emerges as a solid bet at +500 odds, considering the Chiefs' previous celebration with orange Gatorade after winning the Super Bowl in 2020<a href=# class="inline-flex justify-center items-center w-5 h-5 text-xs rounded-full no-underline transition-colors bg-n-purple-300 hover:bg-n-purple-900 text-n-purple-1000 hover:text-white" data-mce-fragment=1 data-mce-href=https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/super-bowl/2024/02/11/2024-super-bowl-prop-bets-sheet-49ers-chiefs/72440334007/ node="[object Object]">1</a>.</p><h2 data-mce-fragment=1>National Anthem Length</h2><p data-mce-fragment=1>The duration of the national anthem performance is another widely anticipated prop bet.
