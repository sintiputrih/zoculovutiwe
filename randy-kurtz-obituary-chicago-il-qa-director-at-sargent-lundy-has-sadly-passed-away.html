Fishing, hunting turkeys, cooking, and spending time with friends and family, as well as assisting them with projects, were some of his favorite activities. When he listened to his favorite songs on the radio,</p><p>he enjoyed singing along with them. He found great pleasure in the company of his pets, in addition to his family. Surviving members of his family include his wife of 32 years, Lisa Ann Kurtz (nee: Fleming); his children, Katelynn Kurtz of Lorain and Kyle Kurtz (Rachel) of Norwalk; his grandchildren,</p><p>Jayce, Annalynn, Remi, Kyersen, and Rymer; his siblings, Robert Kurtz, Adam Woodcock, Rick Kurtz, Scott Strunk, and Christina Kurtz Scanlon; and his step father, George Woodcock of South Amherst, and his step mother, Rita Kurtz of Kentucky.
