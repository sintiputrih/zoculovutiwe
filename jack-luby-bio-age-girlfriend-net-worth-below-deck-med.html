In season 3, Below Deck Med transported viewers through the Amalfi Coast for its final Italian episode.</p><p>There are four new cast members this season including Jessika Asai, who will be serving in the role of Stew.</p><p>Jack hailed from Liverpool, England. He stated that she spent 3 years in yachting and 14 years as a chef.

He put it in the galley while I was away, and I threw it away. The next morning, he asked for a sea urchin omelette so I woke up the diver and forced him to dive in the sea and get me a sea urchin,” Jack’s guest.</p><p>Jack added, “During charter, you really work and earn your money. Off charter, it’s easy to forget about reality. You start thinking you own the yacht yourself.”</p><p>Viewers will also see new stew Jessika Asai, bosun Ruan Irving, and two new deckhands Haleigh Gorman and Lara Du Preez.</p><p>On the other hand, the returning cast members are Natalya Scudder and Kyle Viljoen as co-second stews, Tumi Mhlongo as chief stew, and Deckhand Luka Brunton.</p><p>At BravoCon in 2022, Below Deck Med season 8 and the other Below Deck franchise shows received renewals. According to Heavy, Captain Sandy Yawn teased details about season 8, saying, “[…] you’re going to get the drama, you’re going to get the beautiful experiences that people have. The food, the best cuisines on the planet, are prepared by a chef […] So that’s the highlight of the show.”</p><p>Notably, Captain Sandy said nothing about any drama that might be developing in the season which premiered on 28 September 2023.</p><p>Along with the cast members and start date, the Below Deck Med season 8 trailer was also made public. The crew hook-ups in the trailer were mostly between Luka and the majority of the female crew members. Additionally, there were some arguments inside the interior crew, particularly between Natalya and Kyle and Natalya and Tumi.</p><p>Below Deck Mediterranean is already establishing itself as a must-watch this year.</p><h3><strong>How Much Is Jack Luby Net Worth?</strong></h3><p>In 2023, Jack Luby has a net worth under $150 thousand.</p><p>Jack began his career as a chef at Chapter One Restaurant.
