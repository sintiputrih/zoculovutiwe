She said: “Mine was a particularly terrible case. By my late 30s/early 40s, my thought was, ‘I don’t think that it’s going to be.’ It would have been a medical miracle if I had been able to get pregnant. Still, it wasn’t out of the realm of possibility. In the end, though, as hard as it was to watch the door close, I didn’t fight very hard to keep it open.”<br>However, Oliver accepted the reality and said that she would not spend money on fertility treatments and surgery despite her salary and net worth being so high. She further added that she was happy with the way nature chose her to be.</p><p>According to Oliver, people’s opinions really makes her sad as they do not understand that she is happy by herself. Oliver says: “I went to a class reunion two years ago, and when the topic of kids came up it was a bit awkward. People just don’t understand it. They don’t believe that I am happy. They were still saying to me, at age 47, ‘Oh girl, it’s not too late,’ and I am like, ‘I don’t think so, honey.’”</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-910 data-method=placement-service></span><h2><u><strong>Pam Oliver and Alvin Whitney's divorce</strong></u></h2><p>Despite, all this, it seemed like Oliver and Whitney’s relationship was going really well.
