<a href=../../whats-bigger-8mm-or-5-16-html.html></a>
Answer
Many toolmakers regard 5/16 and 8mm to be interchangeable. 5/16 is about 2 thousandths of an inch smaller, 0.06096mm, but it shouldn’t matter on a hardened Allen bolt, and I’ve never stripped the internal socket of a hardened steel Allen bolt.
Are 8mm and 5/16 the same thing? due to the fact that there are just 0.04/16 “By computation, there is a discrepancy of 0.0625mm. As a result, the 8mm will be too big for the 5/16″ fastener, while the 5/16” will be too tiny for the 8mm.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Category:Colosseum characters - Bulbapedia, the community-driven Pokmon encyclopedia</h2><time>Mar 7, 2024</time>
