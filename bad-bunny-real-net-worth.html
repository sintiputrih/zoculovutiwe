His song, MIA with Drake quickly became a hit and opened the door for him to be featured on Cardi B's I Like It alongside J Balvin. His undeniable talent and likeability have kept him both in the limelight and in the hearts of listeners both old and new.</p><h2 id=what-is-bad-bunny-39-s-real-net-worth>What Is Bad Bunny's Real Net Worth?</h2><p>Though his career began in 2013, Bad Bunny released his debut single in 2016, Otra Vez with Kelmitt and Darell. The SoundCloud release along with several others quickly became popular with their uptempo beats and reggaeton influences. As his fame grew, the assumption was, so did his net worth.</p><p>While the pay raise from his early days is significant, it seems that sources just can't stick to one number. Wealthy Gorilla <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">clocks his number in at about $8M million</a>, while PopBuzz <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">doubles that at $16M</a>, and Net Worth Spot gives him a whopping estimate of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">somewhere between $86.93M and up to about $121.71M</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As one of Spotify’s most-streamed artists, <a href=#>Bad Bunny's $16M report in 2021</a> gives way to accuracy while $8M may leave fans guessing where his wealth went in 2022. With Net Worth Spot providing the most recent information, the assumption is that their numbers are closest to what is true. As Bad Bunny's career continues to skyrocket, whatever the number, it's bound to increase with his popularity.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# title="The Truth About How Bad Bunny Came Up With His Stage Name">The Truth About How Bad Bunny Came Up With His Stage Name</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=how-much-does-bad-bunny-earn-per-year>How Much Does Bad Bunny Earn Per Year?</h2><p>Like many artists, Bad Bunny has an array of performances and appearances from <a href=#>being on the cover of Playboy</a> to <a href=#>participating in WWE's 37th WrestleMania in 2021</a>. With his staggering number of undertakings, it's safe to say he's making well above six figures. According to one source, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">tickets to a Bad Bunny concert start at $78</a> with an average price of $4808.</p><p>His ticket prices are on par with stars like Doja Cat and The Weeknd. The guess of Bad Bunny's earnings is averaged at about $21.73M per year according to Net Worth Spot. Though they also believe that this is a low estimate that could actually extend to $39.12M.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# title="The Truth About How Bad Bunny Came Up With His Stage Name">Bad Bunny Stuns Fans With His Japanese Lyrics In 'Yonaguni'</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=what-does-bad-bunny-spend-his-money-on>What Does Bad Bunny Spend His Money On?</h2><p>Bad Bunny is known to <a href=#>own multiple cars worth millions</a> but when he purchased his Bugatti Chiron <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">he reportedly didn't know what to do with it</a>. He even told MARCA that when the super sports car was in Puerto Rico every one of his friends would want a picture with it; but since bringing it to the United States, the surrounding hype has lessened significantly. Still, not enough that he felt comfortable keeping the $3M ride.</p><p>Though it's not just cars that seem to be catching the "Lo Siento BB:/" singer's eye. Bad Bunny also enjoys frequenting sporting events alongside his girlfriend Gabriela and indulging in romantic trips or quarantine "staycations."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Not immune to bling, he is also a valued customer of jewelry designer Georgina Treviño. She designed a number of accessories for his “Yo Perreo Sola” music video in which he dressed in drag and required a beautifully embellished choker. However, since his girlfriend's own jewelry business is seemingly taking off, it's rather possible that Gabriela will be his first call for any new adornments.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>10 Facts About Bad Bunny And His Girlfriend, Gabriela Berlingeri</a></span></p><h2 id=why-can-39-t-anyone-agree-on-bad-bunny-39-s-net-worth>Why Can't Anyone Agree On Bad Bunny's Net Worth?</h2><p>With Bad Bunny's net worth numbers tens of millions apart from one another fans speculate that it's because of his Puerto Rican naturalization and record labels colliding. Being currently signed to Rimas Music based in Puerto Rico and Universal Music Latin Entertainment -- a subsidiary of Universal Music Group -- based in Los Angeles, California there are many overlapping and headbutting financial factors.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Many sources may factor in one label and not the other or even eliminate is revenue from a platform like YouTube entirely. On the video-sharing site alone, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">he makes $3-$7 for every one thousand views</a>. With 38.5M subscribers, not factoring in these numbers may be detrimental to finding his true net worth.</p><p>Nevertheless, Bad Bunny admirers everywhere continue to support and love the singer. Having only reached the beginnings of his fame his net worth is sure to change again before being properly appraised. Fans can only hope to one day see the true number and be pleasantly surprised.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=# title="What Does Bad Bunny's Girlfriend Do For A Living?">What Does Bad Bunny's Girlfriend Do For A Living?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiZmpxdl8KvuthmqZ6ZnGK7psCMsKarrJhk</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./robert-farley-bio-cause-of-death-job-caleb-farley-father.html><span>←</span><span>Who Was Robert Farley?
