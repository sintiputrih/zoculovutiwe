Her brother Brad claimed that the crew in the ship’s nightclub was giving her “special attention,” which led the family to believe Amy was smuggled off the ship and into sexual slavery. Several sightings of a woman with the same tattoos as Amy were reported in Barbados with one man saying a woman he met in a brothel had the same name. However, no one has been able to locate her since. </span><span class=credit>YouTube</span><h2 class=title>The Unlikely Construction Of Florida's Coral Castle</h2><span class=caption-body>Many find it hard to explain how Ed Leedskalnin, who stood just over five feet tall, was able to carve and manipulate 1,100 tons of coral into this monument for his unrequited love. Had he mastered the skills of the pyramid builders or was there black magic involved, as a few people claimed to witness? Leedskalnin worked under the cover of night for 28 years to construct this mysterious and beautiful <a href=#>coral castle</a>. He died in 1951 - the year it was finished.</span><span class=credit>Pixabay</span><h2 class=title>Whatever Happened To Little Bobby Dunbar?</h2><span class=caption-body>Four-year-old <a href=#>Bobby Dunbar</a> vanished from Louisiana in 1912. His reappearance led to a custody battle, an incredible DNA test 90 years later, and a wrongly convicted man. As it turned out, the Bobby that returned was not who the family believed he was, and the whereabouts of the real Bobby Dunbar is still a complete mystery. </span><span class=credit>Wikimedia Commons</span><h2 class=title>The Disappearance Of Kris Kremers And Lisanne Froon</h2><span class=caption-body>On April 1, 2014, <a href=#>Kris Kremers and Lisanne Froon</a> left their host family’s home in Panama, and it would be the last time anyone would see them alive. More than 10 weeks later, a backpack was found near a rice paddy containing the girls’ cell phones and the camera roll revealing a recognizable trail, along with some disturbing details. Police searched the area and found bones from both women, but no suspects were ever apprehended.</span><span class=credit>YouTube</span><h2 class=title>Who Did The Saddle Ridge Hoard Belong To?</h2><span class=caption-body>A California couple discovered 1,411 old gold coins while walking their dog in 2013. The half-buried treasure found in a tin can, now referred to as the <a href=#>Saddle Ridge Hoard</a>, is worth $10 million dollars - yet no one knows who buried it. The coins are in pristine condition, appearing to have never reached circulation, which lends greatly to both their value and the mystery of who they belonged to.</span><span class=credit>Wikimedia Commons</span><h2 class=title>Nicholas Barclay And His Imposter, Frederic Bourdin</h2><span class=caption-body><a href=#>Nicholas Barclay</a>, 13, was a troubled kid who went missing in 1994 and turned up three years later. But after being reunited with his family, not all was as it seemed. This Nicholas had a different eye color and a new attitude, yet the family had zero doubts that this was their missing son and sibling. One suspicious suicide and a crazy story later, this mystery is no closer to unraveling than it was in 1994.</span><span class=credit>YouTube</span><h2 class=title>The Bone Collector Of West Mesa, New Mexico</h2><span class=caption-body>In 2009, police discovered the skeletal remains of 11 women and one unborn baby in makeshift graves along a trail in Albuquerque, N.M., prompting a massive manhunt for the serial killer deemed the <a href=#>West Mesa Bone Collector</a>. The victims were women between the ages of 15 and 32, died between 2003 and 2005, and were involved in prostitution and/or drugs. No official suspects have ever been named in the serial killings, so the perpetrator may still be lurking. </span><span class=credit>Official Cold Case Investigations</span><h2 class=title>Who Killed Chuck Morgan?</h2><span class=caption-body>Tucson escrow company owner <a href=#>Charles “Chuck” Morgan</a> disappeared for three days in 1977, and upon his return, he indicated that he could not speak because his throat was painted with a hallucinogenic drug. Two months later he disappeared again, and despite his wife receiving a call from a woman who called herself “Green Eyes” saying Morgan was ok, his body was discovered in the desert, shot in the back of the head with his own gun. Though it was ruled a suicide, it didn't add up. Morgan's body was found in a bulletproof vest and one of his teeth was found in his car.</span><span class=credit>YouTube</span><h2 class=title>This Antikythera Mechanism, An Ancient Computer From The Bottom Of The Sea</h2><span class=caption-body>The <a href=#>Antikythera mechanism</a> is a 2,000-year-old device that is thought to be history's first computer. The tool is so advanced, its technology wouldn't be seen again for 1,000 years. It was found in the Aegean Sea in 1900 and was used in astronomy to take measurements so precise that it enabled its user to predict celestial events like eclipses. The next closest technology was the clock in the 14th century. So, the question remains, how was this mysterious contraption made? </span><span class=credit>Flickr</span><h2 class=title>Who Was The Cleveland Torso Murderer?</h2><span class=caption-body>In four years, the <a href=#>Cleveland Torso Murderer</a> killed, dismembered, and castrated 12 different victims, and was never identified. Some victims were found with their dismembered limbs near each other, while others took days to piece together, like a morbid jigsaw puzzle. There were a couple arrests that led nowhere, and despite the well-known detective Eliot Ness becoming involved, the case went cold. </span><span class=credit>Bettman/Getty Images</span><h2 class=title>The Baffling And Deadly Dyatlov Pass Incident</h2><span class=caption-body>In January 1959, nine Soviet college students were killed under mysterious circumstances while hiking through the Ural Mountains in what's now known as the <a href=#>Dyatlov Pass</a> incident. The 23-year-old ski hiker Igor Alekseievich Dyatlov and his team embarked on a journey to reach a mountain peak in the Northern Urals and never to returned. Instead, investigators would only find their diaries, photos, and frozen mangled corpses. From a Yeti attack to secret military tests, hundreds of theories have popped up, yet there have been no conclusive answers.</span><span class=credit>Krivonischenko’s camera</span><h2 class=title>The Hauntings And Murders At The Cecil Hotel</h2><span class=caption-body>From the <a href=#>Black Dahlia</a> to Elisa Lam, Los Angeles' <a href=#>Cecil Hotel</a> is one the most infamous buildings in horror history. Over 16 different deaths by non-natural or strange occurrences have taken place at the hotel over the years. At one point, serial killers Richard Ramirez and Jack Unterweger even called it home. Ghost stories and rumors still abound, the hotel served as the inspiration for season 5 of <a href=#>American Horror Story</a>.</span><span class=credit>Wikimedia Commons</span><h2 class=title>The Spontaneous Human Combustion Of Mary Reeser</h2><span class=caption-body>On July 2, 1951, <a href=#>Mary Reeser</a>’s landlady dropped by to deliver a telegram and found her doorknob unusually hot and feared a fire. She called the police who entered Reeser’s apartment and found it warm but intact. However, Reeser’s body was nearly disintegrated in her chair by a blaze of “white-hot intensity.” Since it requires three or four hours of temperatures around 3,000 degrees Fahrenheit for a body to be cremated, the case baffled authorities, and it was thought to be a case of spontaneous human combustion.</span><span class=credit>YouTube</span><h2 class=title>The Vortex Of The Mirny Diamond Mine</h2><span class=caption-body>Tucked into the remote wilderness of Siberia, the <a href=#>town of Mirny</a> would be entirely unremarkable, save for one thing. There’s a giant hole in the middle of it that’s over 1,000 feet deep and half a mile wide which in its heyday, churned out a suspiciously unnatural amount of diamonds. Oh, and it’s also a vortex that sucks in anything that flies overhead.</span><span class=credit>Wikimedia Commons</span><h2 class=title>$43 Million In U.S. Cash Found</h2><span class=caption-body>On April 12, 2017 agents of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission <a href=#>found $43.4 million in U.S. cash</a> (as well as some British sterling and Nigerian naira) inside an otherwise empty apartment in Lagos. Authorities don’t yet appear to have an explanation for its presence, save one disguised woman reportedly seen visiting the apartment while carrying bags.</span><span class=credit>Economic and Financial Crimes Commission/Facebook</span><h2 class=title>The Oak Island Treasure</h2><span class=caption-body>The mystery of the <a href=#>Oak Island treasure</a> has existed for centuries, but is the mysterious part how nobody has managed to find this buried treasure or whether it exists at all? Oak Island is a 140-acre piece of land located along Canada’s Atlantic coast off the shores of Nova Scotia. Treasure hunters are drawn there for what has been dubbed the “money pit,” believing there are riches left over from the Golden Age of Piracy (1650 and 1730). </span><span class=credit>Wikimedia Commons</span><h2 class=title>The South Pole's Only Murder</h2><span class=caption-body>Posted at a U.S. scientific research station at the South Pole in 2000, Australian scientist <a href=#>Rodney Marks</a> fell ill with nausea and fever. Just 36 hours later he was dead, and while unfortunate, nobody expected foul play. However, doctors later found methanol in Marks’ system, with no explanation or cooperation from the station's other inhabitants. To this day, no one knows how far the investigation went, or how much the U.S. was able to discover about the poisoning of Rodney Marks.</span><span class=credit>YouTube</span><h2 class=title>The Lost Colony Of Roanoke</h2><span class=caption-body>It’s been the subject of fascination for centuries; what really became of the missing first colonists that settled in <a href=#>Roanoke in the 1580s</a>? Did they get killed by disease, leave on a boat, or assimilated into a nearby Indian tribe? Recently, new clues have been uncovered on colonist John White’s 428-year-old map of the area as there are patches that could indicate where citizens of Roanoke relocated. </span><span class=credit>Wikimedia Commons</span><h2 class=title>Robert The Doll's Haunting</h2><span class=caption-body>For almost 115 years, <a href=#>Robert the Doll</a> has fascinated, spooked, and mystified the public. Even today, strange occurrences continue to happen in the allegedly haunted doll’s presence. Robert can apparently move across the room on his own, follow you with his creepy eyes, and wreak havoc on your life if you disrespect him. The mysterious Robert the Doll now sits safely behind glass in a Florida museum and is rarely taken from his case.</span><span class=credit>YouTube</span><h2 class=title>The Gruesome Murder In Room 1046</h2><span class=caption-body>On Jan. 2nd, 1935, a lone man checked into <a href=#>room 1046 of the Hotel President</a> in downtown Kansas City under the name Roland T. Owen. Possessing only a comb and a toothbrush, the staff said he displayed odd behaviors such as sitting alone in the dark with the door locked from the outside. Some mysterious phone calls, notes, and room visits later, the mystery culminated with a bellhop finding a bloodied and tortured Owen, whose death is still unexplained.</span><span class=credit>YouTube</span><h2 class=title>Whose Dismembered Feet Are Washing Up On Beaches?</h2><span class=caption-body>Since 2007, <a href=#>16 severed feet</a>, still in shoes, have washed up on the beaches of the Pacific Northwest. Some suggest we’re finally seeing the remains of victims who went down in a nearby plane crash in 2005. Others suggest we’re seeing victims of the 2004 Asian tsunami; their bodies pulled northwards over the course of ten-plus years by the strong Pacific current. Others still suggest, of course, a serial killer. Law enforcement generally suggests a far more basic answer: suicides and accidents.</span><span class=credit>Pixabay</span><h2 class=title>The Vanishing Of The Sodder Children</h2><span class=caption-body>The chilling story of the Fayetteville, West Virginia <a href=#>Sodder children</a> leaves more questions than answers. On Christmas day, 1945, a fire consumed the home of George and Jennie Sodder, leaving five of the couple’s 10 children dead. Or were they? Their remains were not found charred in the home, and there were sightings of them reported to police. Nevertheless, the children at the center of one of American history’s most infamous unsolved cases were never found.</span><span class=credit>Smithsonian</span><h2 class=title>The Bizarre Case Of The "Somerton Man"</h2><span class=caption-body>Of all the cold cases, the mystery of the <a href=#>"Somerton Man"</a> could be the most bizarre and unsolvable. In late 1948, a couple found an immaculately dressed dead man on Australia’s Somerton Beach; outside of these simple facts, any new evidence collected only seems to lead investigators in circles. For instance, inside a secretive inner pocket in the man’s pants was a tightly rolled scrap of paper that read ‘Tamám Shud’; Persian for ‘it is ended.’</span><span class=credit>Wikimedia Commons</span><h2 class=title>The Tree-Flattening Tunguska Event</h2><span class=caption-body>One day in 1908, an <a href=#>explosion 1,000 times greater</a> than the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima erupted in the remote Siberian wilderness, flattening 80 million trees in the area. While some signs point to a meteor, there was no crater at the epicenter of the blast. Other theories include a small comet or a natural gas explosion from the Earth’s crust. What caused this devastating blast is still being questioned. </span><span class=credit>Sovfoto/UIG/Getty Images</span><h2 class=title>Wayne Williams And The Atlanta Child Murders</h2><span class=caption-body>Though <a href=#>Wayne Williams</a> was officially convicted of two unrelated murders, he was also thought to be the Atlanta Child murderer who killed 27 kids between the late 1970s and early 1980s. A lack of evidence prevents further prosecution in those cases, and Williams maintains his innocence in the case of the Atlanta Child Murders to this day. </span><span class=credit>Wikimedia Commons</span><p class=social-callout>Like this gallery?<br>Share it:</p><img decoding=async alt="Kris Kremers And Lisanne Froon Unexplained Mysteries" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img///allthatsinteresting.com/thumb/630.501.allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/kris-kremers-lisanne-froon.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> 25 Unexplained Mysteries From Around The World View Gallery<p class=dropcaps>Unexplained mysteries never fail to pique our curiosity.</p><p>While supernatural events and conspiracy theories are fascinating, it's the murders and disappearances that are especially antagonizing.
