Who said being famous was always fun?</p><p>Let's take Gary Busey for example, whose acting career began in 1967, which seems like eons ago if you're counting. So, <a href=#>how did Gary Busey really end up with a net worth of $500,000?</a></p><p>Well, <a href=#>Busey's net worth had been shrinking since 2012</a> and by the looks of things, he does not seem to be doing better in 2022. But who knows, maybe he is happy financially and to him, there might be other things to life at this point of his life.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# title="What Happened During Lena Dunham's Failed Riding In Cars With Boys Audition?">What Happened During Lena Dunham's Failed Riding In Cars With Boys Audition?</a></span></p><h2 id=how-did-gary-busey-rise-to-fame>How Did Gary Busey Rise To Fame?</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>William Gary Busey was born on born June 29, 1944, in Goose Creek, Texas, and later moved to Tulsa, Oklahoma. He attended Bell Junior High School and Nathan Hale High School. He enrolled in a community college in Kansas and then transferred to Pittsburg State University in Kansas on a football scholarship. He wanted to be a professional football player until he suffered an injury to his knee and lost his athletic scholarship. He transferred to Oklahoma State University and dropped out just one class short of graduation. He became interested in acting in college.</p><p>Busey first started working as an entertainer when he was a drummer in a band in the 1960s and '70s under the pseudonyms "Teddy Jack Eddy" and "Sprunk." Busey made his film debut in 1974 in "Thunderbolt and Lightfoot" as a supporting character opposite Clint Eastwood. He had his first breakthrough role in "The Buddy Holly Story" in 1978. Busey played the title character and was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actor. He was awarded the Best Actor award from the National Society of Film Critics for this role.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>During the summer of 2019, it was announced that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Busey would play God in the Off-Broadway musical "Only Human."</a></p><p>In 2020, Busey appeared on the television show, "Gary Busey: Pet Judge," on Amazon Prime. On the show, Busey presides over a court in which the plaintiffs and defendants resolve fights about their pets. It isn't a reality show. It's scripted and cast with actors and every bit as strange and hilarious as it sounds.</p><p>As of 2020, Busey is slated to appear in three upcoming projects: the documentary "The Gettysburg Address," and the films "Reggie: A Millenial Depression Comedy" and "Rabere."</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# title="What Happened Between Tom Cruise And John Travolta?">What Happened Between Tom Cruise And John Travolta?</a></span></p><h2 id=what-happened-to-garu-busey-39-s-net-worth>What Happened To Garu Busey's Net Worth?</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Famous people can not do things that the average person can<strong>. </strong>What do you think would happen if Drake walked down to the supermarket on a regular day? He would be mobbed and hounded for autographs and pictures. Celebrities and other famous people cannot lead the lives of normal people. They may be forced to live in their own little secluded world, and will generally be unable to do things that the average Joe can. This disadvantage of being famous can stop celebrities from indulging in the little pleasures of life, which can be very frustrating indeed.</p><p>However, maybe Gary used this opportunity to go out there and live his best life. So, could that mean <a href=#>Gary Busey is spending too much of his shrinking net worth</a>, or is that his plan to live fully before he passes on?</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# title="What Fred Willard Really Thought Of His Career Before He Died ">What Fred Willard Really Thought Of His Career Before He Died</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As for his net worth, well, <a href=#>it took a huge hit due to failed investments</a>, among other things according to Celebrity Net Worth.</p><p>"In the filings, Busey states that he has less than $50,000 in real assets and roughly $500,000 – $1 million in debt to various parties including the IRS, Wells Fargo, UCLA Medical Center, and others."</p><p>An abundance of medical bills and rehab stints, failed marriages and poor real estate investments would also factor in, despite his many years of work in the industry.</p><h2 id=what-is-gary-busey-up-to-today>What Is Gary Busey Up To Today?</h2><p>Gary Busey has long been considered one of the most eccentric actors of his generation and has appeared in more than 150 movies. There is more to Busey’s outlandish personality than Hollywood eccentricity. In 1988, the actor underwent significant changes in a motorcycle accident that came close to ending his life.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While he recovered from his physical injuries, Busey suffered permanent brain damage. Busey’s actor son Jake Busey on the state of his father’s mind after the crash said that “the post-accident version of him turned his personality up to 11.”</p><p>Today, he is at home in Malibu, California. Busey, aged 78, is hard of hearing, so his wife, Steffanie, a hypnotherapist and standup comedian, is here for support.</p><p>He still has a magnificent nest of ash-blond hair, great blue eyes, and huge white teeth that wouldn’t look out of place in Yosemite National Park. Cancers have nibbled away at bits of his face (he has no tear ducts or sinuses), but he is still strikingly handsome in his own chewed-up, spat-out, hard-living kind of way.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=# title="Neil Patrick Harris Revealed What It's Like To Work With An Intimacy Coordinator On Uncoupled ">Neil Patrick Harris Revealed What It's Like To Work With An Intimacy Coordinator On Uncoupled</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiemqqpYq%2B2v8SyZKedpGLEsL7ToWSdnaSWtq2%2Fjg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./simona-tabasco-age.html><span>←</span><span>Simona Tabasco- Wiki, Biography, Age, Height, Net Worth, Boyfriend</span></a>
