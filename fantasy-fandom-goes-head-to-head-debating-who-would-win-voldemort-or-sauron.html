Deeming Sauron as the obvious winner between the two, they went on to explain that the heir of Slytherin, a Hogwarts house known for being cunning and ambitious who aims to obtain power, would immediately “succumb to the master ring”, adding that only a Hufflepuff would be able to take the ring to Mount Doom. Anyone but a Slytherin could possibly defeat Sauron, basically.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-reddit wp-block-embed-reddit" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><a href=#>Comment</a> from discussion <a href=#>Zer0nyx’s comment from discussion "Sauron (LotR) VS Voldemort (Harry Potter)"</a>.</figure><p data-characters=396 data-current-count=696 data-injectable=true>Answering the previous user, someone comically and truthfully answered that Dobby the House-Elf should be the one carrying the ring to Mount Doom. This reply sparked yet another discussion within the thread, regarding Dobby and his ambition to help the House Elves, meaning he could potentially succumb to the ring too. So it seems like Dobby won’t be defeating Sauron anytime soon either.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-reddit wp-block-embed-reddit" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><a href=#>Comment</a> from discussion <a href=#>UltimateIssue’s comment from discussion "Sauron (LotR) VS Voldemort (Harry Potter)"</a>.</figure><p data-characters=229 data-current-count=529 data-injectable=true>For some, this debate is a no-brainer, defending that “Sauron is a higher demigod” and that he would not give Voldemort even a glance while stomping him. The user also says “they are on a different level.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-reddit wp-block-embed-reddit" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><a href=#>Comment</a> from discussion <a href=#>CloverTeamLeader’s comment from discussion "Sauron (LotR) VS Voldemort (Harry Potter)"</a>.</figure><p data-characters=723 data-current-count=1023 data-injectable=true>One particularly interesting reply does agree that Sauron is a “god-like being” whom they enjoy comparing to “Lucifer in the Bible”, however, they decide to cast their vote for Voldemort, with quite the intriguing reasoning. Due to Sauron’s abstract powers, one can assume Voldemort’s feats are superior because we can see them. The user also defends that, although Voldemort “can’t destroy Sauron entirely,” he would most likely be more than capable of “destroying Sauron’s current physical form” and even “banish him into obscurity”. This would mean, that for an undetermined time, Voldemort would be the ultimate winner in their fight.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-reddit wp-block-embed-reddit" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><a href=#>Comment</a> from discussion <a href=#>the_man_in_the_box’s comment from discussion "Sauron (LotR) VS Voldemort (Harry Potter)"</a>.</figure><p data-characters=511 data-current-count=811 data-injectable=true>After the first reply regarding Voldemort as the winner, more and more people shared their reasoning behind the wizard’s conclusive win. One user was actually rightfully reminded that Sauron was banished after getting “his finger cut off by a (slightly superhuman?) man with part of a shattered sword.” Considering it only took one person to banish Sauron for thousands of years, this argument stresses that Voldemort could easily conquer the same feat “from a hundred feet away.”</p><p data-characters=253 data-current-count=253 data-injectable=false>This particular thread shows an incredibly thorough analysis of the worlds of Harry Potter and The Lord of the Rings, bearing the ultimate question: if Sauron is more powerful and basically undefeatable, does that mean Hobbits are stronger than Wizards?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJonZqmpJbAunnFmqWdp51itLCx0mafnpmUYsGweceemJ1llJqvosDIp55mr5ikeri71KWbZq%2BZo3q3u8udnKanoql6sL6MrJiuqp%2BjfA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./why-kris-jenner-founded-a-church.html><span>←</span><span>Suspicious Fans Think Kris Jenner Founded A Church For Dishonest Reasons</span></a>
