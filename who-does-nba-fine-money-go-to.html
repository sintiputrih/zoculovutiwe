This success is in no small part due to the talent and hard work of its players. However, when players cross the line on the court, they can face fines that can range from thousands to millions of dollars.</p><p data-mce-fragment=1>Draymond Green, a basketball player known for his technical fouls, has been fined $200,000 over the past two years. While the fines themselves don't bother him, Green is curious about where the money goes. The answer is spelled out in the CBA, or collective bargaining agreement. Player fines go to charity, with half of the <a href=#>money</a> going to the NBA for administrative expenses.</p><p data-mce-fragment=1>The union's previous executive director was fired for mismanaging fine money, which led to the current system. The fines are announced by an NBA vice president and can range from thousands to millions of dollars depending on the infraction. Players like Green and Chris Paul have questioned where the fine money goes in the past.</p><p data-mce-fragment=1>But where does the charity money actually go? The NBA uses a formula to distribute the money to various charities and causes, with a focus on education, health and wellness, and youth development. The league works with organizations such as the Thurgood Marshall College Fund, UNICEF, and the Boys & Girls Clubs of America, among others.</p><p data-mce-fragment=1>The NBA also has a program called NBA Cares, which partners with charities and non-profit organizations to support communities around the world. The program focuses on areas such as education, youth and family development, and health and wellness. NBA Cares has donated millions of dollars to charity over the years, including funding for disaster relief efforts.</p><p data-mce-fragment=1>Some players have suggested that they should have a say in where their fine money goes, or that the NBA should be more transparent about the distribution of funds. However, the league has been adamant about avoiding any hint of impropriety and ensuring that the money goes to worthy causes.</p><p data-mce-fragment=1>In addition to fines, the NBA also donates a portion of its revenue to charity through initiatives such as the NBA Foundation, which aims to increase access and support for Black youth and their families. The league has pledged to donate $300 million to the foundation over the next decade.</p><p data-mce-fragment=1>Overall, the NBA's fine money goes to charity, with half of the funds going to the league for administrative expenses. The money is distributed through a formula that focuses on education, health and wellness, and youth development. While some players have questioned the transparency of the system, the league has been committed to ensuring that the money goes to worthy causes and avoiding any hint of impropriety.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiekaOus6%2FHZ5qopV%2BXubCz0midmqZdlr%2BktI6wn6hllKSytHnNm5hmnpmjsm65zqecsmWXpHq1uw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./satellite-images-show-lahaina-devastation-in-stark-contrast.html><span>←</span><span>Satellite images show Lahaina devastation in stark contrast | News, Sports, Jobs</span></a>
