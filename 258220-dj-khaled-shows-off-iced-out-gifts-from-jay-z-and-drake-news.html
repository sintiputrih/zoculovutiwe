"It's a Roc-A-Fella piece with a Cuban. I'm being honest, this was personally his. It wasn't like I'ma give you a chain and the Roc piece. No, no, no. This is his. His, off his neck. This is very special to me. I'm honored and grateful to have this gift. I remember the day I got it, it was a special day. It's beautiful. Shout out to Jay-Z."&nbsp;<a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">He also showcases another gift from the homie Drake,</a> in celebration of the&nbsp;Asahd's birth. "Two Keys," says Khaled, highlighting the beautiful piece. "I didn't expect no gift from no one, and I got a gift from Drake!"&nbsp;</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Khaled also highlights his iconic "I call&nbsp;her chandelier!" Patek, a piece his fans know all-too-well. "Baguettes in the face. Bezel, wrist. This the anniversary edition. Big face. What we did was, we put baguettes all in it and it turned into a chandelier." Khaled reveals that the initial price tag was listed as one million, but he used his maxed-out speech bar to whittle it down. "Now it's a chandelier. If you ever need lighting, if I'm doing a show or something, I be needing lighting. Shine bright like a diamond."&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvTp5ywoJmltbC8jZympmdiaoVzfo9mm6Nlm52urbHDZqqhp6eoerCyxWagnJ2UYry2wIygoJ%2Bso2Kzs7vMZqGasV2veqK6w2abq5mbmnqvsdas</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./betty-draper-in-hit-and-run-html.html><span>←</span><span>Betty Draper in Hit and Run</span></a>
