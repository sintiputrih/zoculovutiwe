Let’s take a journey back in time and explore the antiquated ways our ancestors sought to help their fellow man…</p><h2>Trepanation</h2><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-68224 alt=Trepanning width=700 height=467 data-sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/trepanning-mental-illness-treatment.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-68224 class=wp-caption-text>A painting depicting trepanning.</p><p>Even in the Stone Age, primitive peoples were able to recognize mental illness, though their method of dealing with it was as far from our current ways as their culture is from ours. In short: they would cut holes in each other’s heads.</p><p>This “treatment” was used all over the globe, with the manner of cutting ranging from using stone knives to cutting the bone in a circle and then lifting the disc away, to drilling a circle of holes placed close together and then cutting in between them. The skull would be penetrated, but the membrane surrounding the brain would be left intact.</p><p>Trepanning was used to treat insanity, epilepsy, melancholy, and any number of other mental ailments, but the common theme of the procedure seems to be that cutting a hole in the head would release evil spirits and relieve the patient of their anguish. Sometimes, the piece of bone was given to the afflicted person or their family afterward, as a talisman.</p><p>Astonishingly, the practice continued until as recently as the 18th century, when it was finally given up as the mortality rate hovered somewhere around 25 percent. Even today, any type of psychosurgery is considered to be experimental and not to be taken lightly. The chances of drilling a hole in someone’s head with stone tools to release the demons inside being a successful method of treatment? Slim to none.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiZnKHBqa3TrKCnrJWnsrTAyKeeZ5ufonyptdKtpquhk5a5bq%2FUq5ysZZakv265xKermqRdnrmtusSsqg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./theories-swifties-have-about-the-meaning-behind-taylor-swifts-iconic-lyrics-folklore-evermore.html><span>←</span><span>Theories Swifties Have About The Meaning Behind Some Of Taylor Swift's Iconic Lyrics On 'Folklore' A</span></a>
