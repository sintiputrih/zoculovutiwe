I just don't get it. It says that I have seen 150, obtained 138 in Pearl, which is Sinnoh. Which is good because I know of exactly 12 Pokemon that I do not have yet. BUT, Sinnoh is comprised of #s 387-493. Shaymin, Phione, Manaphy, others show to be #s 489, 490, right around there. So that IS within 387-493. Doesn't that mean they should be part of the Sinnoh Pokedex?? Since, like I said, numbers 387 to 493 make up the Sinnoh Pokedex and that is the dex for Pearl.</p><p>Or am I getting something wrong here??</p><p>That's all I wanted to know...</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiapaGvorPAq5uepl6jsrV706GpnpmUqHyuxYyppqysXZ7AbrPOp5xnaWVqg3R%2Fjg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./jaime-camil-is-married-to-wife-heidi-balvanera-kids-526578-html.html><span>←</span><span>Jaime Camil is Married to Wife: Heidi Balvanera.
