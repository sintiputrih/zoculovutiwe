While Thorne and Mascolo were engaged throughout the duration of shooting, the pair broke it off and called it quits in the summer of 2022, mere months before Game of Love landed on digital and VOD, which must have been an uncomfortable press tour to put it lightly.</p><p data-characters=531 data-current-count=531 data-injectable=false>Not that the behind the scenes uncoupling has dissuaded streaming subscribers from checking it out, though, given that <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">FlixPatrol </a>has named the sultry European tale to have staked its claim as the seventh most-watched movie on Hulu in the United States. A lot of people probably wouldn’t have guessed it was even a sequel at all, but the tabloid-friendly Thorne’s involvement would at least ensure that a lot of her many followers were aware she and Mascolo were no longer set to be married by the time of the premiere.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJomGakpajBp8HLZqqeqaWauW65wJ2cZq2emLyuss6rq5qanK56osPKsJirnF2Xsqe70Z5koqxdmsOmuoyrnKWdkaiypXnSrZyapaNiwrF506GcZqukp7Kiucinnmasn6V6cnyO</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./alone.html><span>←</span><span>'Alone' Latest News and Updates</span></a>
