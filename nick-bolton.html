He is the eldest son of Carlos and Jalunda Bolton, originally from Texas.</p><p>He was brought up with his siblings in his homeland, Frisco. Bolton has a half-sister named Jazmin Dunn. In addition, he has three younger siblings.</p><p>Nick enrolled in a local school nearby his residence in Frisco. Although he was not the top student in his class, the young boy showed exceptional interest in extracurricular activities.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Nick-Bolton-and-his-mother-Jalunda-e1659611288986.jpg><p>His muscular physique, incredible athleticism, and interest in sports from a young age helped him become the player he is today. Bolton has been drawn to football since he was a toddler.</p><p>His father, Carlos, was a huge football fan, so he made all his children watch the games together with him on TV whenever he had free time.</p><p>Nick often re-enacted the moves he saw on the television and practiced them with his siblings in their living room.</p><p>As his elder half-sister, Jazmin, was an outstanding football player herself, it was easy for Bolton to have regular football practice sessions at home.</p><p>Sadly, his elder sister could not continue her sports career as she suffered a severe illness later.</p><p>On the brighter side, however, Jazmin always stood by Nick and watched him become a better linebacker as the days went by. Nick completed his high school education at Lone Star High School in his hometown.</p><p>After graduation, he joined the University of Missouri for his higher education. However, he left his academics unfinished to pursue a professional football career.</p><h3>Bolton: Leader Since Childhood</h3><p>Bolton’s early life might seem quite joyful when one knows that he had supportive parents and playful siblings alongside him.</p><p>However, it was not that simple, as he saw two of his closest family members suffer a severe disease before he was out of his teens.</p><p>His sister, Dunn, his closest playmate, suffered from a brain tumor when she was in college.</p><p>Fortunately, his sister became better and recovered fast after she underwent an 11-hour-long surgery, bringing back a smile to young Bolton’s face.</p><p>Following this tragic episode, the Bolton family was struck with another tragedy when his mother, Jalunda, was diagnosed with breast cancer five years later.</p><p>However, Nick had already grown up to be a calm and confident man, strong enough to care for his family in every way.</p><p>Those unexpected incidents left a deep impression on him and made him realize the significance of dedication and struggle.</p><p>He witnessed his sister and mother defeat such grave diseases with immense willpower, inspiring him.</p><p>His brother, Jayden, remembers those tough days and admits that Nick always acted mature beyond his age and told others not to panic.</p><p>Besides, Nick is well-informed about the racial injustices the African-American community often faces in the United States.</p><p>He has been actively participating in peaceful protests against racism since he came to understand racial issues.</p><p>He says the main motive behind his participation in such events is the will to create a safe society.</p><h2>Career</h2><h3>College Career At Missouri</h3><p>After having an excellent high school career at Lone Star, Nick opted to play college football for the Missouri Tigers in 2018. While with the Lone Star, he worked harder on improving his skills and recorded 130 tackles in his senior season.</p><p>However, Nick’s first season at Missouri did not go as expected, as he could only achieve 22 tackles in all 13 games.</p><p>Fortunately, he made a remarkable comeback the following season, recording 103 tackles.</p><p>Although his junior season was cut short and reduced to just ten games because of Covid-19, he had 95 tackles and two sacks in 2020.</p><p>The player received many honors for his performance, including First-team All-SEC and AP Second-team All-American.</p><h3>Pro Day Performance & Scouting Report</h3><p>Nick had already shown himself to be a promising defenseman while he was just in the second year of his college. However, Bolton was ready for his Pro Day performance after his junior season with the Mizzou.</p><p>The player, who measured around 1.80 meters and 237 lbs. then, had considerable Pro Day numbers of 4.60 40-yard dash, 4.50 20-yard shuttle, and 7.40 three-cones.&nbsp;</p><p>Later on, after various tests, the scouting reports concluded Nick had great speed and agility despite his heavyweight.</p><p>In addition, the scouts said he had some disadvantages because of his height, but he somehow managed to shine.</p><p>However, in the end, the scouting report concluded that he was an okay player and was probably a second if not third-round NFL prospect.</p><h3>NFL Career</h3><p>Almost as predicted, Kansas City Chiefs drafted Nick Bolton as the 58th overall pick in the 2021 NFL Draft. He eventually signed a deal with the Chiefs on May 13, 2021.&nbsp;</p><p>Bolton played 16 matches in his rookie season, finishing it with 112 tackles, one fumble recovery, and one defensive touchdown.</p><p>Following his rookie season performance, the PFF’s Sam Monson ranked him 16th Best NFL Linebacker.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Nick-Bolton-in-the-Kansas-City-Chiefs-jersey.jpg><p>Furthermore, Nick also won the Mac Lee Hill Rookie of the Year for his performance in the 2021-22 season.</p><p>Bolton finished the 2022 regular season with 180 tackles – the second-most in the league behind Jaguars’<a href=# rel=noopener> Foye Oluokun</a> (184 tackles) and a single-season franchise record of the Kansas City Chiefs.</p><p>After making it to the 2023 Super Bowl LVII, the Chiefs will face the Eagles, scheduled for Sunday, Feb. 12, with kickoff set for 18:30 Eastern time.</p><p>The Chiefs will strive for their fifth Super Bowl glory since 1967 (I), 1969 (IV), & 2019 (LIV), having lost in the finale of the 2020 season (Super Bowl LV) to the Buccaneers.</p><h2>Awards & Achievements</h2><p>Some of Nick Bolton’s awards and achievements are:</p><ul><li>PFWA All-Rookie team (2021)</li><li>First-team All-SEC (2019, 2020)</li><li>AP Second-team All-American (2020)</li></ul><h2>Health Updates & Fitness</h2><p>The Kansas City Chiefs’ young linebacker has rarely suffered injuries and performed well in the 2022-23 season.</p><p>Looking back at his injury records, Bolton had never suffered severe health conditions except when he broke his ankle while he was a fourth grader.</p><p>Similarly, the Chiefs had briefly kept him out of the squad in December 2021 when he enlisted in the Reserve/Covid-19 list.&nbsp;</p><p>Besides, everyone knows him as a fit and healthy man with a stout physique and immense strength.</p><p>Looking at his well-maintained body, one can assume he does regular workouts and has a proper diet plan.</p><h2>Net Worth</h2><p>According to sources, Nick Bolton has a net worth of around <strong>$1 million </strong>as of November 2023.
