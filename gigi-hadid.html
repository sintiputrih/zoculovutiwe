However, the power couple has yet to speak publicly about their new addition but has shared it with close family and friends.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-36450 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/fresherpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Gigi-Hadid-on-her-birthday-with-Zayn.jpg alt="Gigi Hadid" width=650 height=445 data-sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-36450 class=wp-caption-text>Caption: Gigi Hadid and Zayn Malik cuddling on her birthday bash. Source: Instagram</p><h2><span id=Gigi_Hadid_8211_Relationship_Status>Gigi Hadid – Relationship Status</span></h2><p>Gigi Hadid has been in a romantic relationship with Zayn Malik since November 2015. The lovers broke up in March 2018 and reconciled in June 2018. Again, they split up in November 2018 only to reunite in December 2019. Zayn is a singer and songwriter born and raised in Bradford, West Yorkshire. He initially gained fame as a member of the English boyband One Direction. Zayn left the band in March 2015 and later signed a solo recording contract with RCA Records.</p><p>She previously has been in relationships with Tyler Cameron in 2019, Joe Jonas in 2015, and Cody Simpson from 2013 to 2015, and also appeared in his music video Surfboard, Nick Jonas in 2012, and Patrick Uretz in 2011. Similarly, she was once linked with Lewis Hamilton in 2015.</p><h2><span id=Timeline_of_Gigi_and_Zayn8217s_Relationship>Timeline of Gigi and Zayn’s Relationship</span></h2><p>Three months after breaking off his engagement to Little Mix’s Perrie Edwards, Zayn Malik started dating her. This comes after she also splits with Joe Jonas earlier that month. Days after the reports, people saw the new couple holding hands in their first major moment of PDA. Moreover, paps captured photo evidence that Hadid’s lock-screen on her phone was Zayn’s face but the couple continued to play coy. In a radio interview, Zayn revealed he and she are “good friends, yeah.”</p><p>Later that month, she starred in Zayn’s “PILLOWTALK” music video, and following this, the two engage in some probably intentional over-the-top flirting on Twitter. Later, Zayn confirmed that she was his girlfriend while chatting with Zach Sang & The Gang. The pair then stared in a steamy photoshoot for Vogue, where they made out all over Naples. Then for the “Manus x Machina: Fashion in an Age of Technology” Met Gala, the pair walked the red carpet as a couple, looking like a pair of wildly stylish robots.</p><p>Shortly after, some sources reported that they had broken up but in an interview with Elle in May 2016, she&nbsp;shuts down breakup rumors in the most subtle way and when asked if she likes a night out or a night in:</p><p>“Night in. Cook. Paint. Play with my dog. Hang out with my boyfriend. Watch movies. Just chill.”</p><p>Moreover, she and Zayn did a couple’s shoot for a gender fluidity-themed cover. However, the couple got major backlash because neither of them is gender fluid. Later, the pair spent the Muslim holiday Eid al-Adha with both of their moms.</p><h4><span>On-and-off Relationship</span></h4><p>After reports of a split surface, the couple both confirm their breakup with painfully well-written Twitter posts. On their posts, the pair showered each other in compliments. Following the breakup, Zayn unfollowed both her and her mom Yolanda on Instagram but that didn’t last long. A month later, they were back together. TMZ caught them making out very publicly in the streets of NYC. Then in June 2018, she posted the Zigi confirmation to her Instagram Stories after attending the Oceans 8 premiere.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-36451 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/fresherpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Gigi-Hadid-with-Zayn-on-his-birthday-bash.jpg alt="Gigi Hadid" width=650 height=365 data-sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-36451 class=wp-caption-text>Caption: Gigi Hadid and Zayn Malik saw together during Zayn’s birthday after their breakup. Source: Metro</p><p>Moreover, in the GQ cover story, Zayn opened up about her. Despite speculation that the two may be back together, Zayn explained why they won’t put a label on it anytime soon and said:</p><p>“I’m really thankful that I met her…We’re adults. We don’t need to put a label on it, make it something for people’s expectations. I had a very negative outlook on things [while recording my first solo album]. That might have been adolescence or testosterone or whatever the f*ck was running through my body at the time. She’s helped me to look at things from a positive angle.”</p><p>On June 28, Zayn was spotted in New York City rocking sunglasses from the capsule for Vogue Eyewear, according to Vogue. Plus, he was also wearing a Wrangler x Peter Max tee that she wore the same on June 1. Likewise, the fan-run Instagram account @exposingfakeeasszigiii posted various “confessions” about her relationship with Zayn, calling it fake and for promotion. To this, she responded after finally having enough.</p><p>On 23 August 2018, she and Zayn joined the latter’s family to celebrate the Muslim holiday of Eid. They spent time with Zayn’s mom, brother, and sister, and also shared some super cute pics on Instagram. She also posted a photo on her Instagram story of Zayn and his sister with the caption, “Home for Eid.” This is the second year in a row the couple has spent the holiday together. The same month, she wore a “Zayn” necklace out and about with her bae.</p><h4><span>2019 and Beyond</span></h4><p>However, in January 2019, the pair officially called it quits though earlier reports said that the couple was just spending some time apart. Although she tried to make things work, Zayn had “a lot of his issues that she couldn’t help him get through.”</p><p>But the same month, paps spotted her leaving Zayn’s New York City apartment in the wee hours of the morning. This sparked rumors that the pair might be back together after breaking up earlier that month. To make things more confusing, Zayn randomly tweeted his love for her and wrote, “@GiGiHadid love you”.</p><p>In December 2019, she dropped a major hint that Zigi is probably together. She posted a photo of her cooking on Sunday afternoon. She tagged Zayn’s mom and mentioned using one of her recipes:</p><p>“Sunday in the kitchen: about to marinate the chicken for one of my favorites!!! @mammamalik’s Chicken Curry Pasta Salad. Hopefully, she’ll share the recipe with the world one day”.</p><p>After months of speculation, Hadid confirmed that the pair is back together. She shared a photo on her Instagram story showing off her bedside table that featured a photo of the pair cuddling. This came a month after people spotted them in NYC twice in one weekend. They celebrated the birthdays of both her mom and Zayn.</p><p>Since then, the lovers have been together. They were each other’s Valentine in 2020 and they are even spending time together during the quarantine and global pandemic.</p><h2><span id=Quarantining_Together>Quarantining Together</span></h2><p>It looks like the power couple is socially distancing together right now during the coronavirus pandemic. Gigi Hadid posted photographs from her 25th birthday celebration on Instagram and wrote that she was happy to spend it with her “quarantine family”, which also includes Zayn.</p><p>The photo she shared includes her lover and her sister Bella. They’re holding up some birthday balloons. The three seem to be getting along very well despite probably staying together 24/7 for the past few weeks. In another set of pictures, we see more of the celebration, including a shot of Zayn embracing his girl most sweetly.</p><p>The last time the lovers broke up was in January last year, with a source telling E! that “both had been focused on themselves and their separate careers”. It seems like, after a rocky few months, the pair is going strong again and enjoying their time in quarantine together.</p><h2><span id=Gigi_Hadid_8211_Professional_Life>Gigi Hadid – Professional Life</span></h2><p>Gigi Hadid is a fashion model and an actress.&nbsp;She began her modeling career at 2 years old.
