The fragment that contained Atlas was given to Sadao Maou 300 years before he became king of the Demons. He was rescued by this angel and given a purple crescent-shaped crystal that he kept safe in his castle. After he left with Ashiya, Lailah entered and sent the shard to Earth, where it would find its way to Sadao and Emi.</p><p data-characters=239 data-current-count=239 data-injectable=false>While Atlas mostly takes the form of a child, she actually plays a bigger role in the world of Ente Isla.
