We’re not quite sure how proud one should be about this fact, but Victor has hair measuring up to 7.12 inches sprouting from the center of his outer ears.</p><p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nepAlWkXgWw</p><h2>Human Records: Furthest Eyeball Popper</h2><p><img decoding=async alt="Eyeball Popping" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.imgur.com/RiNSn.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>Putting Mr. Martinez from Daria to shame, American Kim Goodman can pop her eyeballs a creepy 0.47 inches beyond her eye socket. The feat was measured in Turkey in 2007.</p><h2>Human Records: Longest Maggot Bath</h2><p>Though beyond our comprehension why anyone would want to set this record, a British woman, Christine Martin, sat in a bath with maggots for 1 hour and 30 minutes, on what we can only assume was a crazy day in 2002.</p><h2>Insane Human Records: Most Stretchy Skin</h2><p><img decoding=async alt="Most Stretchy Skin Picture" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.imgur.com/fwGNC.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p><img decoding=async alt="Ten Utterly Insane Human Records" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.imgur.com/DZ8Cw.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>Garry Turner of Britain can stretch his skin up to 6.25 inches, less due to an amazing talent and more so a medical condition, Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome. The disorder of connective tissues affects the skins, ligaments and internal organs, allowing Turner to distend his skin to unnatural lengths.</p><h2>Most Rattlesnakes Held In The Mouth</h2><p><img decoding=async alt="World Record For Most Rattlesnakes In Mouth" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.imgur.com/JdtXj.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p><img decoding=async alt="Jackie Bibby Rattlesnakes Pictures" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.imgur.com/04tDb.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>Though not quite sure what possessed him to do it, Jackie Bibby, USA, holds the record for most, live, rattlesnakes held in his mouth. In 2001, he held eight, by their tail, for 12.5 seconds.</p><h2>Insane Human Records: Longest Fingernails, Female</h2><p><img decoding=async alt="Gigantic Female Fingernails Picture" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.imgur.com/xa929.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p><img decoding=async alt="Human Records Longest Fingernails" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.imgur.com/0HrSp.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>68 year-old, Lee Redmond, USA, used to hold the record of the longest fingernails for a woman. She started growing them in 1979, and by the time of official measurement in 2008, they reached 28 ft 4.5 in length. Unfortunately, the three decade long effort was wasted in early 2009 when Lee lost her nails in a car accident.</p><h2>Heaviest Weight Pulled With Eye Sockets</h2><p><img decoding=async alt="Utterly Insane Human Records Pulling Weight With Eyesockets" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.imgur.com/ixRxB.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>The Space Cowboy, aka Chayne Hultgren, holds the bizarre and painful record of pulling the heaviest weight with his eye sockets. In 2009, the Australian pulled 907 pounds (humans and cycle) on the ‘Lo Show Dei Record’ show in Italy.</p><h2>Farthest Nasal Ejection Of Spaghetti</h2><p>Kevin Cole, of New Mexico, USA, holds the record for blowing the longest spaghetti strand out of a nostril in a single blow. Cole started spraying Ramon noodles out of his nose, and then slowly progressed on to spaghetti. His crowning achievement was recorded in 1998, with his spaghetti strand measuring 7.5 inches.</p><h2>Insane Human Records: Farthest Squirting Milk From The Eye</h2><p><img decoding=async alt="Eyeball Milk Squirting Picture" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.imgur.com/qzOm2.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>Ilker Yilmaz, a construction worker from Turkey, can squirt milk from his eyes up to 9 ft 2 in, which he disgustingly proved in a hotel in Istanbul in 2004.</p><h2>The Contortionist Who Can Fit Through A Tennis Racquet</h2><p><img decoding=async alt="Utterly Insane Human Records Captain Frodo Contortionist" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.imgur.com/jZJ6Z.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>Captain Frodo, born in Norway and living in Australia, is known as the ‘Incredible Rubberman’ for his crazy contortionist ways. Born double jointed, Captain Frodo holds the record for being able to swallow the most swords, but his real trick is his ability to squeeze head and shoulders through the head of a tennis racquet.</p><p>If you enjoyed seeing these ten utterly insane records, be sure to check out All That Is Interesting’s posts <a href=#>the greatest mysteries in human history</a> and <a href=#>mindblowing facts about the world</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiZnKHBqa3TrKCnrJWnsrTAyKeeZ5ufony1sc1mrK2slae5unnIp6qappVitba5wKdkq52TpL%2Blvw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./surfer-mikala-jones-dies-after-suffering-severed-artery.html><span>←</span><span>Surfer Mikala Jones dies after suffering 'severed artery'</span></a>
