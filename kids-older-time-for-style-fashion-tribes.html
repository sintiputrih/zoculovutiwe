Its main muse is Bridget Jones. I know, I know, an unlikely style heroine. It’s all claw clips, shrunken cardigans, short skirts and opaque tights. &nbsp;Slightly haphazard, a little dishevelled and eclectic. &nbsp;</p><p id=eeUt2fLgOLQ data-wc=36>All this is very cute for today’s youth, who are wearing it with more than a pinch of irony. They are taking time to put it together, curating the clothes carefully so they actually look good.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/39222f100629-img6460.jpg><p id=eI5xUKZuVdJ data-wc=55>Now as somebody who sported the look for real for an entire decade when my kids were young, I can tell you the reality was neither so joyous nor so considered. In fact, I was just picking up today’s clothes from yesterday’s pile. It felt as far away from fashion trends as it could be.&nbsp;</p><p id=e-Lc2g6O9Zk data-wc=44>I had zero minutes to myself and all my funds were spent on things like Infacol and nursery fees. My clothes were slightly too tight on my postpartum body. My hair in need of attention, my coat pockets bulging with raisin snacks. Constantly flustered.&nbsp;</p><h4 class="relatedContentTitleClass_r14hzpr7 hm-heading">More from Rosie</h4><ul class=relatedContentListClass_ra09n5z><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="How I cracked the secret to midlife happiness at 49" class=hm-link href=# rel><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/fa1d5b923e87-rosie-green-jeans.jpg></a><h5 class="miniCardTitle_m1w18s13 hm-heading"><a aria-label="How I cracked the secret to midlife happiness at 49" class="miniCardLink_my4jhwq hm-link" href=# rel>How I cracked the secret to midlife happiness at 49</a></h5><span class=miniCardLine_m1nt9q7p></span></li></ul><p id=e0B9OcqCuFd data-wc=31>It wasn’t how I had envisaged myself looking in my thirties.

It’s sleek lines, big shades, a classic handbag, ballet flats and a trench coat.&nbsp;Oh and some chunky gold jewellery, a blow dry and skin that glows post chic mini break.</p><p id=e2otToayNS3 data-wc=11><strong>READ:&nbsp;</strong><a class=hm-link href=#>Why I'm absolutely not 'dressing for my age' at 54</a><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p id=e7uVfgQWXEh data-wc=40>Rich mom icons are Angelina Jolie, Gisele Bündchen and Katie Holmes. And the queen of it is Kelly Rutherford, the actress who played Lily van der Woodsen in Gossip Girl. Go-to designers are The Row, Loro Piana, Khaite and Toteme.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/bc103750eb37-img6862.jpg><p id=eCKwKuCop9T data-wc=57>As the name suggests if you are a mum of small children you would require serious funds to carry off the look. As well as the wardrobe spend, you’d need a nanny/housekeeper to ensure you didn’t come in contact with your kid’s messy little hands and to look after them while you attended your standing hair appointment.&nbsp;</p><p id=e-LL4Nl_Ip data-wc=13><strong>INSPIRATION: <a class=hm-link href=#>How to get your fashion mojo back in your 40s and beyond</a></strong></p><p id=ePDimOSpFXh data-wc=27>The good news for me? Now my kids are almost grown, I have more time and a bit more cash so I can actually channel this look.&nbsp;</p><p id=ebrwf54QIe9 data-wc=39>It’s part of the joy of reaching this second act stage. I don’t have millions in the bank, but with careful shopping and some time spent on self-care I can achieve something approximating the vibe of Jolie et al.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/71a4e0ce2c11-img8853.jpg><p id=e-6re_szhs_ data-wc=8><strong>Here’s how I get the rich mom look…</strong></p><ul><li>You need a classic, roomy handbag in quality leather or suede, preferably designer. I like See by Chloé for the luxe feel at (slightly) less eye watering prices.</li></ul><ul><li>A white ribbed tank top is a rich mom essential. &nbsp;Reiss do great ones.</li></ul><ul><li>Big shades = non negotiable. All the C’s - Chanel, Chloé, Celine.&nbsp;</li></ul><ul><li>Gold bracelets add interest. Check out Missoma’s chains, just about affordable.&nbsp;</li></ul><ul><li>Ballet flats. Chanel’s are the ultimate, but Loeffler Randall offer great alternatives.&nbsp;</li></ul><p id=enPj5nXVUEH8 data-wc=12><a class=hm-link href=#>&nbsp;Visit HELLO!'s Second Act hub for inspiration on living your best midlife.</a></p><p id=eAQQ-5T2NNpX>&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbHLpaammZeWx6q6xGeaqKVfncKjv46snJynnpl6oq%2FTaGxqbWhugHC3yJ2qZqecmbKzedOipJ5llqS%2Fbr%2FTsqOeZZaWwKm1zqdkraqZl7K0ew%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./francis-bourgeois-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-121014-html.html><span>←</span><span>Francis Bourgeois Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</span></a>
