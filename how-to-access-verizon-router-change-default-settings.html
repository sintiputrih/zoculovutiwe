You will be routed to the login page after pressing ENTER.</p><p><strong>4.</strong> You can then enter the default username and password into the appropriate sections after visiting the login screen.</p><p><strong>5.</strong> Once you’ve logged into the Router, you’ll be able to access and manage all of the options necessary to properly configure your router. However, it is recommended that you update your password on a regular basis to make it safer.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=how-to-change-verizon-router-default-usernamepassword></span><span>How to change Verizon router default username/password</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Now that you’ve known how to login/access into your Verizon router, you might want to change the default username or password, there is a ton of reasons why you might want to do this, one of the reasons is that the default password which comes with the router is always looking like an ALIEN scribbling, this makes it not easy to remember.</p><p>Below are the two easy steps which you can follow to change the password:</p><p><strong>1.</strong> We are assuming you are already on the Verizon admin panel by using the guide above, click the “Change login user name/password” link in the lower left-hand corner.</p><p><strong>2.</strong> You will be taken to a new interface where you can change the default password and username, change it to whatever you want, and remember to note it down somewhere in case you forget again.</p><p>And voila, you’re done.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=how-to-reset-verizon-router-back-to-default-settings></span><span>How to reset Verizon router back to default settings</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>After changing your router password to make it more secure and easy to remember, there are some cases where you might forget. For this reason, we’re including this guide as a bonus guide. Follow the steps below to easily reset your Verizon router to default settings.</p><p><strong>1.</strong> Every Verizon router has a reset button, which is usually located on the device’s back. If you have trouble finding the reset button, please consult the user manual. You can also conduct an online search for your specific model.</p><p><strong>2.</strong> Look for a small or tiny object, such as a needle or a pin. Using that, press down on the reset button at the back of the router for more than ten seconds. After that, you’ll notice the light blinking for a few seconds before the Router turns off and on.</p><p>Your router will now go back to the default password and username.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=wrapping-it-up></span><span>Wrapping it up</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>We hope this guide will be helpful to you.
