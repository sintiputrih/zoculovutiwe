I lived on the money I made as a standup. I wanted to be a comedian. I never thought TV was a job that would last you."</p><p>Leno went on to confirm that he never touched any of his Tonight Show salary "until the very end."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Carolla was stunned by the response, especially given Leno's habits of spending on cars, and giving back to his Tonight Show employees back in the day.</p><p>Leno was able to not only survive, but confirmed that the money is still there in an account.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/jay-leno-claimed-he-did-nothing-wrong-to-david_gr-1.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="Jay Leno Claimed He Did Nothing Wrong To David Letterman After Decades Of Feuding On Late Night">Jay Leno Claimed He Did Nothing Wrong To David Letterman After Decades Of Feuding On Late Night</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>Jay Leno doesn't think he was the villain of his feud with David Letterman over who would host The Tonight Show.</p><p>A remarkable story of how Leno was able to maintain his wealth all these years later.

And in fact, a lot of them shared their personal experiences with the late night host. Not a single negative experience was shared.</p><p>Fans wrote, "Lot of people in LA have a Jay story. Bumped into him once at the only gas station in Beverly Hills, he was filling up up an old banged up Indian motorcycle he was riding around on. I commented on his bike and he just chatted with me for 20 minutes like we were bros. Jay is good people."</p><p>"I was on a flight with Jay Leno - sat next to him for the entire flight. He was a "regular" guy on the plane. No one to meet him at the baggage claim - got his own luggage got on the same bus to the hotel with everyone else. All while doing the Tonight Show. Wore pretty much what he has on in this video. This man is very down to earth and knows how to stay grounded."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/instar52743562-1.jpg> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/both-bill-maher-and-jimmy-kimmel-tensed-up-when-jay-leno-s-late-night-scandal-was-brought-up1.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="Both Bill Maher And Jimmy Kimmel Tensed Up When Jay Leno's Late-Night Scandal Was Brought Up">Both Bill Maher And Jimmy Kimmel Tensed Up When Jay Leno's Late-Night Scandal Was Brought Up</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>Bill Maher and Jimmy Kimmel seemed uncomfortable while talking about Jay Leno's Tonight Show exit.</p><p>Another fan had a sense of appreciation for one of Leno's quotes during the podcast interview.</p><p>“I don’t have girlfriends or cocaine habits, so you can save a tremendous amount of money!” Truer words were never said!

You know, when you start making money, you get lazy. I wanted to make sure I always had that hunger, so I never looked. It would go directly into a bank.”</p><p>A great story, and one that is very different compared to other tragic tales in Hollywood of the opposite holding true.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGihmrFdobKvu4ycpqeemae6prCMq6ymp6JiwbC6yKCfrWWjnby4edaemKWsmGQ%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./tell-me-something-good.html><span>←</span><span>Tell Me Something Good | Rufus Lyrics, Meaning &amp;amp; Videos</span></a>
