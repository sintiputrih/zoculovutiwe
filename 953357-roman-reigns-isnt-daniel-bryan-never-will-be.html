Ever since the build to WrestleMania 34, the narrative for Roman Reigns has been that “management doesn’t want him to win the title.”
Week after week for the past few months, there have been either subtle remarks along these lines, or Reigns has cut a promo specifically beating us over the head with this idea that somehow, the powers that be in WWE are actually against him being the champion."><meta name=author content="Jenniffer Sheldon"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>
