It is <strong>located near the Potions Room</strong> and can be found in the image below.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/attackofthefanboy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Hogwarts-Legacy-Depulso-Room-1-Location.jpg><p data-characters=166 data-current-count=166 data-injectable=false>In <strong>the hallway with lots of portraits</strong>, you’ll see a red marble well with a square contraption. If you cast Depuslo on that, the Depulso Room 1 Puzzle will open.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>How to Solve the Depulso Room 1 Puzzle in Hogwarts Legacy</h2><h3 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>Treasure on the Right Side of the Room</h3><p data-characters=172 data-current-count=338 data-injectable=false>Once you are in the main puzzle chamber, your goal is to get all three treasure chests near the three lanterns. To do that, you need to <strong>use Depulso and Accio on the blocks</strong>.</p><p data-characters=408 data-current-count=746 data-injectable=true>For starters, before you jump down, use Depulso on the cube that is on the third level on the right side of the room. After that, jump down and use Depulso on the second level block in the middle of the room to push it to the right. Use Depulso on the first level block that was next to it to push it to the right side of the room. Now, climb up the blocks on the right side of the room to get that treasure.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/attackofthefanboy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Hogwarts-Legacy-Treasure-on-the-Right.jpg><p data-characters=125 data-current-count=425 data-injectable=true>With the first treasure done, <strong>use Depulso on a cube to crush yourself against a wall</strong>. This is the only way to reset the room.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>Treasure on the Left Side of the Room</h3><p data-characters=362 data-current-count=362 data-injectable=false>With the room reset, before jumping down, use Accio on the second level block. Since cubes attach if they are moved together, jump down and use Accio to pull the two cubes you just created at the back of the room. Accio them to the center of the room. Now, you created a mini stair structure with two first level cubes on bottom and one second level cube on top.</p><p data-characters=371 data-current-count=733 data-injectable=true>Use Depulso on the two cubes close to the treasure on the left side of the room so they are out of the way. Use Depulso and Accio to get the stair structure where those two first level cubes where. Then, use Depulso to pull the two first level cubes back to where they were. You should now have four first level cubes together with one second level cube at the back left.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/attackofthefanboy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Hogwarts-Legacy-Treasre-on-the-Left.jpg><p data-characters=281 data-current-count=581 data-injectable=true>The last step is to use Accio on the third level cube to pull it left, back, right, and then forward to the left side treasure. If you have done all that, you should be able to climb your structure and get the treasure on the left side of the room. <strong>Reset </strong>by pulling cubes into you.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>Treasure at the Front of the Room</h3><p data-characters=215 data-current-count=215 data-injectable=false>First, jump down and use Depulso on the middle two cubes, the first and second level cubes, to push them to the front of the room. Then, push them again so they are cornered against the wall at the back of the room.</p><p data-characters=299 data-current-count=514 data-injectable=true>Then, use Accio and Depulso to pull the two level one cubes at the base of the treasure on the left side to the right, front, left, and then front. Then, use Accio and Depulso to pull the cube on the other side of the treasure on the left side to the right, back, right, front, left, and then front.</p><p data-characters=198 data-current-count=198 data-injectable=false>If you do this correctly, you’ll have three level one cubes that will act as your bridge to get across the gap. Push the three level one cubes left so they are attached to the two stack cubes.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/attackofthefanboy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Hogwarts-Legacy-Treasure-at-the-Front.jpg><p data-characters=155 data-current-count=155 data-injectable=false>With that done, jump onto the stone cube near the back and jump onto your bridge. Then, climb up your cubes to get to the treasure at the back of the room.</p><p data-characters=131 data-current-count=286 data-injectable=false>Exit the room by walking across the stone cubes on the right side of the room and then use the stairs on the left side of the room.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>What Reward Do You Get For Finishing the Depulso Room 1 Puzzle?</h2><p data-characters=260 data-current-count=546 data-injectable=true>Once all three chests have been looted, you’ll receive a chest on your way out. This contains <strong>a spellcraft that is Ornamental Stands</strong>. The only other thing you’ll keep after finishing this puzzle is the three items you looted in the treasure chests.</p><p data-characters=188 data-current-count=188 data-injectable=false>The items include <strong>one purple outfit and two green items</strong>. The rewards aren’t all that worth it besides the spellcraft, but the puzzle is fun and you can now move on to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Depuslo Room 2</a>.</p><i data-stringify-type=italic>Attack of the Fanboy is supported by our audience.
