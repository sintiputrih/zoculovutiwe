Catherine was spotted in the royal box with Meghan Markle, the Duchess of Sussex, on Saturday morning for the Women's Championship match, where Serena Williams was defeated by Angelique Kerber, and joined her husband, Prince William on Sunday afternoon for the Men's final between Novak Djokovic and Kevin Anderson.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=1 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">While the match was riveting, most were focused on the Duchess, who sported a bold and bright yellow dress by Dolce & Gabbana, and the most stunning accessory to match–a citrine ring gifted to her by Prince William after the birth of Prince Louis this past April.</p><img alt="Yellow, Gesture, Outerwear, Hand, Long hair, Businessperson, Finger, Smile, White-collar worker, " title="Yellow, Gesture, Outerwear, Hand, Long hair, Businessperson, Finger, Smile, White-collar worker, " width=2000 height=1000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/hbz-kate-middleton-ring-index-gettyimages-999994486-1531761609.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><a rel=noopener href=# class="pinterest css-esp0ot e1c1bym14"><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=auto width=auto alt=pinterest style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p><span class="css-5rd5i8 e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=3 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Kate sported the ring on her right hand, with her wedding band and engagement ring–the iconic heirloom sapphire with a diamond halo that once belonged to Princess Diana–on her left. Citrine is said to be connected to warmth, comfort and a healing energy, as it reflects the power of the sunlight, making it an even more appropriate gift for a new mother. According to <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.hellomagazine.com/royalty/2018071650264/kate-middleton-shows-off-push-present-ring/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=Hello! class="body-link css-1xesb7e emevuu60">Hello!</a>, Catherine added earrings and a necklace from Asprey to complete the look.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Catherine's various moments of concentration during the match gave onlookers the best shots of the newest addition to her accessory wardrobe. She was first spotted sporting her new ring at Prince Harry's wedding to Meghan Markle, which was the Duchess's first public appearance since the birth of Prince Louis only three weeks earlier. She wore the ring on her right hand for the Duke and Duchess of Sussex's ceremony, and paired it with an ivory Alexander McQueen coat and dress.<br></p><img alt="Yellow, Event, Community, Ceremony, Employment, Official, Tourism, " title="Yellow, Event, Community, Ceremony, Employment, Official, Tourism, " width=3624 height=2416 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/hbz-kate-middleton-ring-embed-gettyimages-999415722-1531761631.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><a rel=noopener href=# class="pinterest css-esp0ot e1c1bym14"><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=auto width=auto alt=pinterest style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p><span class="css-5rd5i8 e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">As Catherine has in the past, it is traditional for royals to receive push presents from their spouses. William gifted Catherine with a piece of jewelry to commemorate the birth of both Prince George and Princess Charlotte. In 2015, she received a pair of custom Kiki McDonough green tourmaline, green amethyst and diamond earrings after Charlotte's birth, as pictured on the designer's Instagram.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">After Prince George's birth, the Duchess <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/kate-middletons-baby-bling-duchess-3177695 data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="reportedly received" class="body-link css-1xesb7e emevuu60">reportedly received</a> an eternity band, which she wears alongside her engagement ring. It appears that in addition to his admirable charity work and being a fantastic father, the Duke of Cambridge also has another impressive talent: Prince William knows how to pick out a stellar piece of jewelry.</p><span class="css-3mrz81 ev8dhu51"><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/916d9b02-8867-4c91-934d-6abbc239c04d_1547134719.png alt="Headshot of Carrie Goldberg" title="Headshot of Carrie Goldberg" width=100% height=100% decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p>Carrie Goldberg is HarpersBAZAAR.com’s Weddings & Travel Director.
