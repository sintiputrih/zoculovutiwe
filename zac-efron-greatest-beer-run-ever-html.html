Would you hit store after store looking for the perfect case of suds? Wait in stacked rush hour lanes of traffic? Or, how about crossing into an enemy war zone with bullets flying through the air? While that last one may be the end of the road for a lot of us, that’s not the case for Zac Efron’s <a href=#>character</a>, John “Chickie” Donahue in a trailer for the upcoming feature, The Greatest Beer Run Ever.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><p>The <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">unbelievable true story</a> will transport audiences back to the days of the Vietnam War when the nation was at odds with itself over the United States’ involvement in the life-destroying battles. Zack Efron’s Chickie is living far from the war zone, safely in New York, while his friends fight for their lives abroad. Spending his time shutting down anti-war protestors and drinking at the local bar, the trailer, which you can see below, leads us up to Chickie’s decision to bring beers, PBRs to be exact, to his pals overseas. Hoping to boost morale, Chickie sets off with cases of the good stuff to deliver to the brave soldiers duking it out with enemy forces. But, what starts as a fun mission soon becomes a little too real for the New Yorker as he comes to understand how dangerous his decision really is, possibly putting himself on a collision course with death.</p><p>Based on the Joanna Molloy and John Donohue book of the same name, The Greatest Beer Run Ever was directed by Academy Award-winning filmmaker, Peter Farrelly (<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Green Book</a>). Along with Zac Efron, the comedy-drama will also star the likes of superstars Russell Crowe and Bill Murray. The ensemble cast includes Jake Picking, Will Ropp, Archie Renaux, Kyle Allen, Ruby Ashbourne Serkis, Matt Cook, Omari K. Chancellor, Will Hochman, Goya Robles, Kevin K. Tran, and Sam Hurley.&nbsp;</p><p>It’s been a busy few years for Zac Efron who will soon be appearing in the second season of his Netflix docuseries, Down to Earth with Zac Efron. In it, Efron stars alongside Darin Olien as the two wander the globe and travel to countries including Puerto Rico, Peru, and Sardinia, uncovering cultures and sustainable living ideas practiced in those places. Earlier this year, the actor was seen in another film, Blumhouse’s <a href=#>Firestarter</a>. The Keith Thomas-directed flick served as an adaptation of the Stephen King novel of the same name, and was the second feature to be made based on the book. The film also starred Ryan Kiera Armstrong, Sydney Lemmon, Kurtwood Smith, John Beasley, Michael Greyeyes, and Gloria Reuben.&nbsp;</p><p><br>As for Zac Efron’s role in The Greatest Beer Run Ever, if the trailer is any indication, audiences are in for a laugh-out-loud, heartfelt production that looks to be deeply sponsored by PBR. Grab some friends and of course an ice-cold brewski, and settle into your couch for the story of one man’s quest to bring his friends some crispy suds when The Greatest Beer Run Ever<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"> hits Apple TV+ </a>and select theaters on September 30.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLXAp6ufqpWWuKq60aiZqKxemLyue8Snq2iykZh6prLRqKVmn6KarrWx0q1km52Vp3qzwc1mnK%2BdomO1tbnL</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./195589-nia-long-best-man-fame-shows-love-her-lo-html.html><span>←</span><span>Nia Long of 'Best Man' Fame Shows Love for Her Look-Alike Mom in New Photo Weeks after Her Father's</span></a>
