Maybe now’s the time to consider taking that cruise you’ve always planned or to stop talking about the girls’ trip you’ve been chatting about since college and get booking it; or if you’re the planning type, get your 2024 holidays booked in for the kids’ school half terms already.&nbsp;</p><h3 class="factBoxTitleClass_f1xis0ve hm-heading">The Black Friday travel deals to browse - at a glance</h3><li>TUI - <span><a class=hm-link href=# rel="sponsored noopenernofollow nofollow">They've gone big for 2023, with Black Friday deals across package holidays (up to £250 saving), flights, river cruises and Marella Cruises</a></span></li><li>Jet2Holidays - <span><a class=hm-link href=# rel="sponsored noopenernofollow nofollow">Save up to £60pp with Jet2's Black Friday offers across winter and summer holidays</a></span></li><li>Booking.com - <span><a class=hm-link href=# rel="sponsored noopenernofollow nofollow">Save 30% or more on stays booked by 29 November 2023</a></span></li><li>Lastminute.com - <span><a class=hm-link href=# rel="sponsored noopenernofollow nofollow">Lastminute are giving up to £250 off when you spend upwards of £2,500, and £150 off when you spend over £1,500</a></span></li><li>Hilton - <span><a class=hm-link href=# rel="sponsored noopenernofollow nofollow">If it's a hotel you're after, shop Hilton's Black Friday sale with up to 50% off selected properties</a></span></li><p id=e9TqN3QY1P data-wc=62>Although not all of our favourite holiday companies have dropped their travel Black Friday deals, I’ve done a deep dive into the last few years of Black Friday travel sales to see the sorts of savings you can expect to find and highlighted the deals already available. And fear not, many travel companies have some brilliant discounts anyway, Black Friday or not…</p><h3 class="factBoxTitleClass_f1xis0ve hm-heading">Tips for getting the best Black Friday travel deals</h3><li><strong>Search flights by month</strong> - &nbsp;Try not to get tied to a specific date, instead, do your research and see what’s the cheapest month to fly to your preferred destination. When searching, open your search up to the whole month too – you’ll find some days are cheaper to fly on than others, and prices can vary on the time of day you fly too.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Try different departure airports</strong> - &nbsp;Some airports are cheaper to travel from than others. Of course, if you can’t get to an airport it’s not even worth considering it, but for some, travelling a little further by car to their departure airport might add an hour to the journey but can see savings double. It’s worth noting that some airports are cheaper to park at than others, and some that you might not have considered are far easier to get to by public transport than you might have thought…&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Be open to new destinations</strong> - &nbsp;If you're frantically searching for a cheap trip to New York, chances are, you’re probably not the only one and those deals can sell out pretty quickly. Shop around for inspiration or alternative destinations.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Don't forget to book your staycation</strong> - &nbsp;We don't have to tell you that the UK is just as beautiful to visit as some further afield destinations. Don't dismiss booking your next staycation over the Black Friday weekend too - who needs the Maldives when you've got Margate?&nbsp;</li><h2><strong>See the best Black Friday travel offers</strong></h2><ul class="affiliateProductList_a1p8yzmf affiliateProductList_a1p8yzmf--normal" aria-label="Affiliate products list"><li class=affiliateProductListItem_a15uc6c7><h2 class="affiliateProductName_afobsy4 hm-heading">TUI Black Friday deals</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/53071dcfe9fe-tui-family-holifays.jpg><p>TUI is one of the most popular travel companies in the UK and they always offer great deals, Black Friday or not.&nbsp;</p><p>Their BF offer is a goodie, and includes not just package holidays (up to £250 off) but money off flights, river cruises and their Marella cruises too.&nbsp;<br></p><a href=# class="buttonWidgetButton_b1lxbopb buttonClass_by57jsl -primary" rel="sponsored nofollow"><p>SHOP HOLIDAYS</p></a></li><li class=affiliateProductListItem_a15uc6c7><h2 class="affiliateProductName_afobsy4 hm-heading">Booking.com Black Friday deals</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/ca3df9ce69ba-amsterdam.jpg><p>It’s one of those companies you probably use for booking travel in the UK via, at least, more often than you realise, and for this year's Black Friday, Booking.com have offered up to 30% off selected properties - there's literally hundreds to choose from.<br></p><a href=# class="buttonWidgetButton_b1lxbopb buttonClass_by57jsl -primary" rel="sponsored nofollow"><p>SHOP BOOKING.COM</p></a></li><li class=affiliateProductListItem_a15uc6c7><h2 class="affiliateProductName_afobsy4 hm-heading">Jet2Holidays Black Friday deals</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/a5775fe9aecd-lanzarote-bay.jpg><p>Black Friday has come early to Jet2Holidays – they’re currently up to £60pp on winter holidays, summer holidays and plenty more breaks too.
