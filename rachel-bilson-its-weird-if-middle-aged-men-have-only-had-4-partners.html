(The <a href=#>Hart of Dixie</a> alum and Christensen, 42, <a href=#>share daughter</a> Briar Rose, 8.) Most recently, Bilson dated <a href=#><strong>Bill Hader</strong></a> from 2020 to 2021.</p><p>Bilson has shared several confessions about her sex life on her podcast over the years.</p><p>Following her breakup from Hader, 45, Bilson quipped on a March 2022 episode of her podcast that she was <a href=#>going to miss</a> the actor’s “big d–k.”</p><p>One year later, Bilson revealed that she <a href=#>hadn’t had an orgasm</a> from sex until she was 38 years old — later clarifying that she didn’t <a href=#>blame any of her exes</a> for it.“It has nothing to do with any partner,” she said on a March episode of “The Viall Files” podcast. “It had to do with me knowing my body.”</p><p>In June, Bilson confessed she had also <a href=#>never faked an orgasm</a> with a partner because it “goes against [her] whole nature of being a people pleaser and putting the dude first.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Despite her willingness to be an open book when it comes to NSFW confessions, Bilson revealed in May that she was <a href=#>fired from a gig</a> after sharing she wanted to be “<a href=#>manhandled</a>” in the bedroom.</p><p>“This is the first time it’s ever happened to me in my professional life that I lost a job this week because of things that were said,” Bilson said on “Broad Ideas” at the time. . “A job got taken away from me because I was speaking candidly and openly about sex in a humorous way on our friend’s podcast.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGarmZOdsq15waKjrKeeYra1v4ywnKKqlGK2p3nMopudpJVirqixw2aknqZdna63sYyopaWxXZ2upXmTZqeaqqSjsrO%2Fjg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./daniel-dimaggio.html><span>←</span><span>Daniel DiMaggio</span></a>
