The sheriff’s deputies were called to the chicken restaurant over an accident with injuries.</p><p>The manager made an astounding revelation when he told the authorities that Miller’s order was corrected, and she received her biscuits before the incident, but Miller “was still not happy.”</p><p>According to the report, Miller’s action was not entirely unforeseen. Before the incident, the woman threatened the restaurant’s staff, even calling and threatening to drive her car into the building.</p><p>One of the employees, standing by the entrance, was almost struck by the car during the incident, noted deputies.&nbsp;</p><p>According to the incident report, a witness allegedly waiting in line with Miller was told to hurry and get their order “because she was coming back.”</p><p>Miller returned and allegedly drove her SUV into the chicken restaurant, narrowly missing an 18-year-old employee.</p><p>According to arrest warrants, Miller continued driving after hitting and entering the building until her car was stopped by debris.</p><p>After crashing into the restaurant, Miller fled the scene, according to the report. Her car was discovered at her home with front-end damage.</p><p>According to the Richmond County Sheriff’s Office, Miller was booked into the Charles B. Webster Detention Center on Wednesday, four days after the alleged incident.&nbsp;</p><p>No one knows what was going on in Miller’s mind when she did this, and it’s unknown if she feels any guilt or remorse after being arrested.&nbsp;</p><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XZmpqaZpOkunCzxKipoKGRYsSwucCnZJyqkai1pr%2BMrKyvZZmjwbB5z6innrGVqHqistOeqWaglad6sL7Dnqlmr5Goeq610qygp59dl7a0r9Siq6xn</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./chelsea-handler-net-worth-134605.html><span>←</span><span>Chelsea Handler Net Worth 2024</span></a>
