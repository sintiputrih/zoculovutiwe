It doesn’t talk and just writes so it’s unknown if it even has its own identity. In the film, it was seen as a sentient pen that’s there to assist the Baston family to search for knowledge and information about the Goddesses that are after them.</p><p data-characters=165 data-current-count=165 data-injectable=false>So with this sentient pen’s infinite knowledge and somewhat endearing attitude towards writing and notetaking, was this character also mentioned in the comics?</p><h2 id=h-is-steve-the-pen-in-dc-comics data-injectable=false>Is Steve the Pen in DC Comics?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=465 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=537 data-current-count=537 data-injectable=true>Steve’s first appearance in Shazam! Fury of the Gods was when the Baston family was trying to figure out who the Daughters of Atlas were. Pedro, one of Billy’s siblings, revealed that there is a hidden library in the Rock of Eternity and there lies Steve the Pen, writing Pedro’s book report for school. Despite this character being simple and seen as somewhat of a librarian, the pen is still shrouded in mystery because we don’t know who created it or what its main purpose was other than a handy homework tool.</p><p data-characters=475 data-current-count=475 data-injectable=false>Unfortunately, not much can be told about Steve since it doesn’t exist in the comics. So perhaps this is a case of DC creating a totally original character from scratch. This is a shame since it was an interesting character, even if it doesn’t speak. But this magical pen didn’t betray our heroes, rather, just messed with them a bit since it wrote down everything… including comments and conversations. It really is a handy tool for our family of heroes.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJooKxlo6myt7GMrZ%2BeZaCau261zWabnGWTpLqqr9Jo</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./how-a-strapless-bra-should-fit-7371812.html><span>←</span><span>How to Find a Strapless Bra That Fits</span></a>
