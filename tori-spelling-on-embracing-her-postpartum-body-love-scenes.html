I loved working with him so much. So, the bed scenes with him were easy.”</p><p>Still, the actress added that it’s “tricky” for moms to embrace their postpartum body.</p><p>“We’re human. We have feelings, we have insecurities, and you work hard in your journey on this path to kind of get over that, but there’s ebbs and flows,” she explained. “And I think, as someone who was notorious, for being, you know, a female that very much wore sexy clothes — Donna Martin always had a midriff top on. I was this big my whole life. It’s a different embrace.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Spelling added that she is “just like everyone else,” having good days and bad days when it comes to her body positivity.</p><p>“I see women out there on TV and — I look at <a href=#><strong>J. Lo</strong> </a>and I’m like, ‘Oh, why can’t that be me?’ Of course, I’m human,” she told Us. “[But] it’s kind of embracing what you have. I definitely want to be that role model [for my daughters]. And I have moments where I get flustered and think, like, ‘Do I look OK? I know I’m going to go somewhere, there are people going to be taking pictures of me and my body.’ And then I have to check myself internally and be like, ‘You’re raising two strong women and you need to be at an example that this generation, it can be different for them.’”</p><p>For more from Spelling, watch the video above and see her play Winger’s love interest, Shoshana, when Bigger returns to BET+ Thursday, April 22.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZJunlK58r7HWrGatp6KeerS8xKWjoqaXYryvecSmmauZk567qHnHnqlmqJ%2BowbGt0a2spmWSpLG6ecuorZ5lo5iyr7HSaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./nle-choppa-height-how-tall-is-the-20-year-old-american-rapper-background-net-worth-girlfriend.html><span>←</span><span>Nle Choppa Height: How tall is the 20-year-old American Rapper?
