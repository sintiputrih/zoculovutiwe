Upon seeing its first trailer, we had a surprisingly visceral and negative reaction, completely non-commensurate to what is just another innocuous and ridiculous-looking action movie. We couldn’t figure out what it was that made us so uncomfortable. Until we finally landed on its offense: It was composed almost entirely of scenes, staples, and tropes that had popped up in this very underwhelming summer of movies, all in one trailer — an unintentional supercut of recent box-office crimes, if you will.
