Serialized online since 2016, in pixiv Comic, the shojo manga has amassed eight volumes so far, published in English by Yen Press. In 2019, Harusono began writing a spin-off manga focused on side characters Hirano and Kagiura — titled Hirano and Kagiura. Both Sasaki and Miyano and its spin-off manga have received novelizations.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=181 data-current-count=181 data-injectable=false>Yen Press’s official synopsis describes the playful premise of the boys’ love series about a boy who loves boys’ love but doesn’t realize he also loves boys:</p><p>It all started like a typical old-school boys’ love plotline — bad-boy senior meets adorably awkward underclassman, one of them falls in love, and so on and so forth. But although Miyano is a self-proclaimed boys’ love expert, he hasn’t quite realized…he’s in one himself. Which means it’s up to Sasaki to make sure their story has a happily ever after…!</p><p data-characters=237 data-current-count=237 data-injectable=false>So, if you like BL, know the difference between yaoi and shounen-ai, or just want to watch cute boys explore their first relationship together in a lovingly animated way, then be sure to check the first episode of Sasaki and Miyano out.</p><h3 data-injectable=false>Who’s involved?</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Sasaki-and-Miyano-Key-Visual.jpeg><p data-characters=265 data-current-count=502 data-injectable=true>The prolific Studio Deen, known for classics like Patlabor: The Movie, Patlabor: Early Days, and 07-Ghost, animated the adaptation of Sasaki and Miyano. The studio has made a number of more recent popular and lighthearted series like Sakura Trick and Hetalia.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=303 data-current-count=303 data-injectable=false>Shinji Ishihara of Fairy Tail, Log Horizon, and the yaoi Super Lovers is co-directing the series alongside Takehiro Ueno. Yoshiko Nakamura, another Super Lovers vet, is the series’ composer, while Maki Fujii (I’ve Always Liked You) is responsible for the fashionable character designs.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=182 data-current-count=485 data-injectable=true>Yusuke Shirai voices the titular Sasaki alongside voice actor and singer Sōma Saitō as Miyano. Together, the two perform the show’s ending theme, “Ichigo Sunset.”</p><h3 data-injectable=false>Why you should watch</h3><p data-characters=327 data-current-count=327 data-injectable=false>Funimation has never been known for their BL content, though the platform did notably pick up The Stranger by the Shore film last year. The service also streamed and dubbed Adachi and Shimamura, a yuri anime that felt like queerbait with how reserved and confused its main characters remained throughout the 12-episode season.</p><p data-characters=359 data-current-count=686 data-injectable=true>But in just the first episode of Sasaki and Miyano, Sasaki asked Miyano out (however, noncommittally, he may have played it off). While both boys have to come to a new understanding of their sexuality alongside their new crush, both are honest about what they’re feeling — and I can’t wait to see them stumble through their feels together.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=306 data-current-count=306 data-injectable=false>Others are excited too. The series’ debuted at #16 on <a href=#>MyAnimeList’s</a> Top Airing Anime chart. While BL fans on Twitter have been sharing screenshots of each new character design and every little sign of affection between the two, the most common point of enthusiasm is … how tall Sasaki is.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=606 data-injectable=true>https://twitter.com/myungfvs/status/1480213371798851593?s=20</figure><h3 data-injectable=false>How to watch</h3><p data-characters=527 data-current-count=527 data-injectable=true>Sasaki and Miyano is streaming on Funimation with English, Spanish, and Portuguese subtitles.
